Well, our star, Danny Kim already has the confidence part down, now, all that he needs is Nicole’s approval to let him grow beside her.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Keep reading this Danny Kim Bio to learn all about him</span></p><h3><b>Danny Kim On The Courtship</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Danny Kim was the only Asian-American featured on the inaugural season of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Courtship</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. And he turned that opportunity to show how “Asian men can be sexy and awesome.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, he wanted to let the world know that “when an Asian man falls for a woman, he will do everything to go for the woman he desires.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But with that being said, Danny admits that he doesn’t represent all Asian men.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Joining him this season, in the quest for Nicole Rémy’s love were his co-stars — Rick Edwards, Lincoln Chapman, Daniel Bochicchio, Jaquan Holland, Peter Saffa, Alex “Achilles” King, and 10 others.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Unlike other dating series, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Courtship</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> also featured the lead, Nicole’s side of the family (brought in for her help). They were — Dr. Claire Spain-Rémy (mom), Claude Rémy (dad), Danielle “Danie” Baker (older sister), and Tessa Cleary (best friend).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For Danny, the hardest part about being on the show was against other suitors for one woman. Especially, when it came to fighting for the woman he can “possibly love,” Danny got very competitive. So competitive that it was difficult for him to control his emotions at times.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>On the flip side, the easiest part for the star was being “genuine” on the show. He felt like he could just be himself on the show and that was enough for him to win the heroine.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Overall, Danny had an unforgettable experience with the whole filming process. Being transported back to the regency era and “courting” his possible future queen, felt like a dream world.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But among his countless memories, one part stands out the most — “When I first approached the castle where the heroine lived and saw her for the first time,” he reminisced.</span></p><h3><b>Danny Kim Relationship Status</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Danny Kim was single as of 2022. Or at least, this was what his Facebook relationship status shared.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>We’ve no idea how far he made it with Nicole. However, we do know that Danny has had his fair share of heartbreak. Also, it was his past relationship that pushed him to love himself and become a new person.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Danny Kim?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Danny Kim was 31 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Courtship</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He is five years older than Nicole Rémy.</span></p><h3><b>Danny Kim Family</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Danny Kim comes from a Korean family of four.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It was his father who first moved to the States for studies, and Danny’s mother later joined him. So, during their time apart, the husband-wife would often exchange handwritten letters, which greatly influenced Danny to follow the traditional courtship.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to him, his mother still has those letters his dad wrote to her.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But those letters weren’t the only thing that inspired Danny. On his parent’s 40th anniversary, Danny pulled his dad aside to ask, “Do you still love Mom?” And the reply he received was “‘Yes, she’s my best friend.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“And that’s when I went onto the show, to find my best friend that I can fall in love with,” he explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, though Danny’s looking forward to a modern and yet traditional courtship, his parents still want him to go through the traditional Korean traditional wedding.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for Danny’s sibling, he has a brother who’s very close to him.</span></p><h3><b>Danny Kim Height</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Danny Kim stands tall at a height of around 5 feet 11 inches (180 cm).</span></p><h3><b>Is Danny Kim On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, find him on IG @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>captaindanielkim</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, here’s his Facebook @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>dkwade37</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, TikTok @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>captaindanielkim</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, and Youtube @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>CaptainDanielKim</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Danny Kim Job</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Danny Kim is a former Air Force captain who was later inspired by the movie </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Hitch</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> to start a business as a confidence coach for men.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Talking about his military career, Danny graduated from the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Air Force Academy</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2012, earning a degree in systems engineering management, and was immediately stationed in South Korea. He then went on to serve in Oklahoma and Los Angeles later, before leaving the service in 2018.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Recalling his training, Danny shared that the experience was “brutal,” and he was not prepared for the yelling. Also, he was once unable to recite the Airman’s Creed and was forced to stand up in the front of the class while his classmates did push-ups.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>After retiring, Danny then went on to work as a freelance model and a confidence coach at a dating and lifestyle consulting company.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But why take a job as a confidence coach, you ask? Well, ever since Danny was a child, he had huge insecurities about his body. He even labeled himself to be a “fat and ugly Asian kid.” So, when he hit puberty, the lad got into bodybuilding and went through a successful weight loss journey.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And now, Danny flaunts a ripped body. No wonder, he chose to be a confidence coach.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, after </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Courtship</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, Danny plans to pursue acting in Korea and represent Korean Americans in Asian media.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Where Was Danny Kim Born?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Danny was born in Seoul, South Korea.
