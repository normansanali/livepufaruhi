This effectively skips the second Route 22 battle against Blue (which would be mandatory in normal gameplay).</p><p>If spoken to, Blue will say his challenge dialogue associated with the second Route 22 battle, but this battle will not start and the player will be able to walk freely through Route 22.</p><p>This does not affect other battles against Blue. For instance, Blue will also still appear as the <a href=# class=mw-redirect title=Champion>Champion</a> in the <a href=# title="Indigo Plateau">Indigo Plateau</a> as usual, even though he will also always be found at Route 22.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Battling_against_early_Blue>Battling against early Blue</span></h3><p>If the player has not yet restarted the game after defeating Giovanni (and has not defeated Brock yet), then it is possible to go and battle the early version of Blue (where Blue still has an unevolved first partner) on Route 22, while the later version of Blue is also present.</p><p>Once this battle is done, the early version of Blue will go away while the later version of <a href=#>Blue will remain permanently on Route 22</a> (the same way as defeating Brock would do).</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Freezing_the_game>Freezing the game</span></h3><p>If both versions of Blue are on Route 22, but the player has already saved and restarted the game after defeating Giovanni, then it will not be possible to battle either version of Blue anymore.</p><p>Once the player enters Route 22 (where both copies of Blue are present), the early version of Blue will challenge the player to a battle, but then he will say the after-battle text without any battle. After this is done, the player will remain stuck in place (in front of the Blue who challenged him) until restarting from the last saved game, with no option to leave or open the menu. (even with the <a href=# title="Walking through walls">walking through walls</a> glitch active, the player would be permanently stuck here)</p><p>The player remains unable to go into the Pokémon League because the Route 22 is effectively blocked, unless the player causes Blue to be stuck <a href=#>permanently on Route 22</a> by defeating Brock or uses the <a href=# title="Walking through walls">walking through walls</a> glitch to walk through the Route 22 while bypassing the two versions of Blue.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Rival_twins_in_the_same_spot>Rival twins in the same spot</span></h3><p>It is possible to see the two versions of Blue in the same overworld tile by <a href=# title="Walking through walls">walking through walls</a> and approaching them from the left side when they are both present on Route 22.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=See_also>See also</span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorzEnaCaZpKquaOtxpqpnZ2eY7umwI6woKShX4e2t63LmKuwoZ6orKi4yK2aoQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
