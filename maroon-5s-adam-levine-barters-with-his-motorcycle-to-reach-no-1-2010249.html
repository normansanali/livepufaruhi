Guess so. The singer's band, <strong>Maroon 5</strong>, just released their third album, Hands All Over, on Tuesday — and now he REALLY wants to make sure it reaches No. 1 on next week's Billboard Top 200 albums chart. So much so that he announced on Twitter yesterday that he will give one lucky fan his personal Harley-Davidson Forty-Eight chopper if the disc debuts in the top spot. In a week filled with new releases from <strong>JohnLegend</strong> and <strong>The Roots</strong>, <strong>Santana</strong>, <strong>Selena Gomez</strong>, the <strong>Zac Brown Band</strong> and even <strong>Liza Minnelli</strong>, guess he knows he's got some fierce competition no matter how many raves the <strong>Mutt Lange</strong>-produced effort is getting.</p><p>Want to help the brother out? Visit <a href=#>www.maroon5.com/harley</a> for details, and if Levine sees his dream come true next week, the contest submissions will immediately go live. But that’s not all, folks. Levine is also tossing in a Rider's Edge course to the lucky winner so they can learn and get their official license. Want even more info? Visit <a href=#>maroon5.com</a> and follow Levine at <a href=#>www.twitter.com/adamlevine</a> (Yep, That’s really him!) and start your engines.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>By <strong>Ian Drew</strong> for <a href=#>UsMagazine.com</a>.
