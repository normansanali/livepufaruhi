Or perhaps you had no way of getting it there because it was&nbsp;completely&nbsp;broken down. Regardless of the reason, having to bring your vehicle into the shop always feels like a dreaded chore.</p><p>Nowadays, you can get all kinds of services delivered straight to your home. Groceries, laundry, that exercise bike everyone’s raving about. So, why not car repair?</p><p>Good news! You totally can with a mobile mechanic service like AutoNation Mobile Service. Mobile mechanics are exactly what they sound like. They provide the ultimate level of efficiency and convenience by coming to your location to repair your vehicle on-site.</p><p><strong>Related content:</strong></p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Benefits of Using a Mobile Mechanic (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Benefits of Using a Mobile Mechanic</a><br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Mobile Mechanic vs. Traditional Repair Shop – What’s the difference?</a><br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>How to Choose a Mobile Mechanic</a><br><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="7 Ways Mobile Mechanics are Practicing Safe Car Repair (opens in a new tab)">7 Ways Mobile Mechanics are Practicing Safe Car Repair</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Where Do Mobile Mechanics Work?</strong></h2><p>While mobile mechanics are awesome in that they come to you, there are a few things to consider in order to provide a safe and efficient work environment.</p><p>For instance, it’s best if your vehicle is parked on a paved surface that is relatively flat to allow the mechanic to safely and easily maneuver under it, if needed. If you have access to a garage or carport, parking your vehicle there for service is preferable. A driveway or parking lot will also work. Ideally, you want to avoid parking your vehicle in the street, on a steep hill, or on an unpaved surface, for safety reasons.</p><p>Keep in mind that most mobile mechanics arrive in trucks or vans that carry all their tools and equipment. Our mobile mechanics at AutoNation Mobile Service arrive in<a href=#> fully-equipped company vans</a>. Ideally, they’d be able to park their vans as close as possible to the vehicle that needs service.</p><p>This might be a bit tricky if you live in an apartment complex with limited parking. Try your best to locate a safe area where the van can park nearby. For those who live in gated communities, remember you’ll need to provide the van access as well.</p><p>While most repairs can be performed at your home or office, there are some jobs that require a shop with a lift. For such repairs, AutoNation Mobile Service has a network of certified shops ready to provide assistance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How Do Mobile Mechanics Work?</strong></h2><p>Working with a mobile mechanic is easy. The process starts with getting a quote and making an appointment online. To get a<a href=#> free, instant quote</a>, all you have to do is tell them a little bit about your car including the year, make, and model, along with the service or services you need. If you’re not sure which services you need, you can describe the issue to the best of your ability – noting any bizarre noises, leaks, or other symptoms you might have noticed. You can also choose to speak directly with one of AutoNation Mobile Service’s expert service advisors over the phone.</p><p>Once you select a day and time that works best for you, we will dispatch a mechanic to your location of choice. The mechanic will arrive in a company van, equipped with all the tools and parts necessary to get the job done. To ensure that they show up with the correct parts, it’s important that you give accurate information about your vehicle. For example, providing your VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) can go a long way in helping the mechanic secure the correct parts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What Kinds of Services Can Mobile Mechanics Perform?</strong></h2><p>Our mobile mechanics have the experience to carry out pretty much every&nbsp; kind of repair, preventative maintenance or safety check on any make or model vehicle. This makes mobile mechanics far more convenient than brick and mortar shops that often specialize in a particular make of vehicle.</p><p>A large number of our call-outs are related to preventative maintenance and vehicle servicing. If your vehicle is subject to a recall you will need to have the work done at a dealership, but our mobile mechanics can perform any other type of preventative maintenance or dealer logbook work, including scheduled maintenance.&nbsp; We can even fill out your vehicle logbook as proof the scheduled maintenance has been completed.</p><p>There is an extensive list of jobs that mobile mechanics can do but the truth is that each AutoNation Mobile Service van carries all the tools necessary to do any job – no matter how big or small.</p><p>For example, some of our most requested services include:</p><p>· &nbsp; Brake service and repair: Our technicians can diagnose any problem with your braking system including a brake pad replacement, brake fluid flush and brake caliper replacement.</p><p>· &nbsp; Common car repairs: Basic maintenance is essential to keeping your car running smoothly and some of our most requested services are an oil and filter change, spark plug replacement and diagnosing a check engine light.</p><p>· &nbsp; Heating and air conditioning: Make sure your car keeps its cool over summer with our heating and air conditioning services such as AC recharging, heater core replacement, and cooling system pressure test.</p><p>· &nbsp; Steering and suspension: It’s not always wise to take the road less traveled – our technicians can help you stay off the beaten track with coil spring replacements, shock and strut replacements and even a wheel alignment.&nbsp;</p><p>Mobile mechanics can perform a wide range of repairs and services directly on-site. Routine maintenance, such as<a href=#> oil changes</a>,<a href=#> air filter replacements</a>,<a href=#> battery replacements</a>, and<a href=#> brake pads replacements</a>, can almost always be handled at your location. If you’re getting your vehicle serviced at work or at a public location, it’s best to check with the property manager first. A mobile mechanic can also perform many common repairs onsite such as<a href=#> alternator replacements</a>,<a href=#> coolant hose replacements</a>, and more.</p><p>There are, of course, more extensive jobs that require a shop with a lift. Say, for instance, your car needs an engine or transmission rebuild. A physical auto repair shop is the best place to tackle a job of that caliber.</p><p>That’s why AutoNation Mobile Service offers a network of certified repair facilities to help out with these more complicated repairs. We are able to arrange for your vehicle to be brought to the shop and brought back to you when the job is complete.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Common Questions Before You Select a Mobile Mechanic</strong></h2><p>What Qualifications Or Certifications Do Your Mechanics Hold?</p><p>There are plenty of exceptional mechanics around that don’t hold certification but shops that prioritize hiring certificated and professionally trained mechanics indicate a workshop is prepared to give their employees work their stamp of approval. If a mechanic is lacking certification it doesn’t mean they are incompetent, but it is one aspect to consider when choosing a mobile mechanic with the both the knowledge and skills required to fix your car.</p><p>&nbsp;Will You Provide An Estimate?</p><p>Nobody likes getting their car back along with a giant bill so providing an estimate can help avoid unpleasant financial surprises. It allows you to see what is required to complete the repair, and prevents the possibility of a dispute after the job is done. An estimate also allows you to compare prices between shops if you so desire, and discuss any discrepancies over price.</p><p>&nbsp;Do You Guarantee Your Work?</p><p>For complete peace of mind, your mechanic should offer a warranty on the work they do. This indicates that they use high quality parts, are part of a team that hires competent technicians and that they value their customers. A business that offers a warranty is an indication they have full confidence in the service they provide.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Are Mobile Mechanics Cheaper than Repair Shops?</strong></h3><p>You may be wondering whether a mobile mechanic or a repair shop is going to cost you less. Additionally, which offers better value and how can you choose between the two? The obvious difference between mobile mechanics and repair shops is that repair shops operate out of a brick and mortar workshop and will have higher overheads and expenses than a mobile mechanic.</p><p>Not being tied to a physical location is a huge cost benefit but mobile mechanics offer a more streamlined process that requires less staff as well. When you call a traditional repair shop you may first speak to a receptionist, who then puts you through to someone to take your booking. When you drop off your vehicle a mechanic will work on it, a workshop foreman or supervisor will sign off on the work once it’s finished before another staff member prepares your invoice. Mobile workshops will typically hire experienced staff that don’t need supervision and can perform more than one job, greatly cutting down on labor and staffing costs.</p><p>So while mobile mechanics have lower operating costs which are passed onto their customers, making them cheaper than repair shops, price alone shouldn’t be the deciding factor when choosing who to trust to fix your car. Instead, it can be used alongside other considerations like customer reviews and warranty comparisons.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What is theDifference Between Mobile Mechanics and Shop Mechanics?</strong></h3><p>A mobile mechanic can carry out car repair and maintenance jobs wherever their van will take them. They travel with what is essentially a mobile workshop that carries all the tools they need to carry out most automotive repairs. Mobile mechanics go wherever they are needed instead of the traditional model of automotive repair that has a customer having to take their car to a workshop, sometimes leaving it there if a lot of repair work is required.</p><p>This leads to two of the advantages that mobile mechanics have, and they are flexibility and convenience. Mobile mechanics visit you at both a time and place that is convenient to you, and you are only without your car during the duration of repair. This differs from shop mechanics who will often ask you to drop off your car first thing in the morning and pick it up at the end of the day.</p><p>Our mechanics can boast that they only use the best tools and diagnostic equipment to fix your car. This ensures that diagnostic tests are done with the most up-to-date software and information directly from the manufacturer, and that repairs are carried out to the highest standard. Shop mechanics usually have to buy their own tools and have to make a compromise between quality and affordability.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Are Mobile Mechanics Trustworthy?</strong></h3><p>We know that your car is one of your most valuable assets and you want to trust it with a dependable mechanic – otherwise you’re leaving yourself completely vulnerable when trouble strikes. Most people prefer to get recommendations for a trustworthy mechanic from their family or friends, but what about when it comes to mobile mechanics who travel wherever they are needed?</p><p>Some places to get reliable opinions are Yelp, where we currently have over 230 customer reviews, Reseller Rating, where we have over 500 customer reviews, or Google, which features over 80 customer reviews. We do this to be totally transparent about the service we provde, and to build trust with our most valuable assets – our customers.</p><p>Ideally when it comes to mechanics you want someone who is dedicated to customer service, does an exceptional job and charges fairly. Consider these 6 tips to help you find out if your mobile mechanic is trustworthy:</p><ul><li>They are easy to contact</li><li>They provide an unfront, written quote for repair</li><li>Each staff members are presentable and professional</li><li>Their technicians are professionally certified</li><li>The company has been in business for several years</li><li>They are featured in the media regularly, both on television and in newspapers</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Are Mobile Mechanics Worth It?</strong></h3><p>We understand that having a car in need of repair can be frustrating, particularly when you don’t know what’s wrong with it or what is required to fix it. Even worse, it can be difficult to know which automotive workshop is trustworthy. We’ve already discussed the advantages of mobile mechanics, so it’s time to answer the question: are mobile mechanics worth it?</p><p>This is a fairly simple question to answer but it depends entirely on which mobile mechanic you choose. A mobile mechanic will do more than the bare minimum, they should go that extra mile to ensure you, the customer, is completely satisfied. An example of this is the concierge service that we offer.</p><p>In the event your vehicle does require a visit to a workshop due to needing specialized repair or diagnostic equipment that we can’t carry in a mobile workshop, our vans are equipped to safely deliver your vehicle to one of our partnered workshops, and return your vehicle back to your place of choosing after the work is done.</p><p>The convenience extends to our booking system as well. When you call a brick-and-mortar repair shop you may have to wait days or even weeks for an available slot. How many customers they can attend to a day is limited by how large their workshop is. With AutoNation Mobile Service, you can choose from several slots, often the next day or options to call for same-day emergency service.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Reasons to Use an On-Site Mobile Mechanic</strong></h2><p>In the age of robo-customer service and video conferencing, a personal touch goes a long way. Our mechanics are not only the best at what they do, they also put the customer first. AutoNation Mobile Service mechanics are always happy to answer any questions about the service they are providing, what is wrong with your car and the best way to fix it so the problem doesn’t happen again.</p><p>Mobile mechanics can also save you money in a variety of ways. Along with lower operating costs, mobile mechanics will provide you a quote if requested, after carefully examining the problem with your vehicle and determining what is needed to get it back on the road. You can also forget towing fees or having to make do with a hire car thanks to the convenience of having a mechanic come to where it’s convenient for you!</p><p>Because of this convenience, you’ll find you are able to make better use of your time instead of waiting around in a workshop for your car to be repaired (and often after they have repaired everybody else’s car as well). When a mobile mechanic is working on your car, you’re free to do whatever you want instead of waiting around.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What to Expect During a Service Appointment</strong></h2><p>It all starts with a booking. Via our website, you can enter your location, contact number, and vehicle details – the make, model and year. Select the service you require from our list of repairs and services, or if you’re not sure what the problem is, use our online diagnosis tool by answering a few simple questions and request and receive a quote if needed. If you need some extra help we’re always available to talk via telephone.</p><p>Parts are preordered for the job and picked up by the mechanic. This helps prevent the problem with tradition repair shops where sometimes you’re waiting for parts to arrive before you car can be fixed. Our technician then arrives at your requested location on time. The mechanic inspects your vehicle to make sure the work you requested needs to be done, and also to check of any other problems that could cause you an issue in the near future.</p><p>Once the job is complete, the technician will explain what work has been carried out and answer any questions that you have. The worksite is cleaned up and any fluids or parts removed loaded into their van for proper disposal. Once you are happy, payment can be made via our secure payment gateway.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How Do Mobile Mechanics Charge?</strong></h2><p>AutoNation Mobile Service offers pricing that is competitive with what you’d expect from your local shop. We take into account the labor rates in your specific area and don’t up-charge simply because we are offering a convenient service.</p><p>When the job is complete, paying for your repair is just as easy as the rest of the process. Once the mechanic finishes the job, they will collect payment from you via credit card, cash, or check. A detailed invoice that you can keep for your records is also sent via email.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What Kind of Warranties Do Mobile Mechanics Offer?</strong></h2><p>Being an informed consumer when it comes to warranties can protect you from parts failure or workmanship that is not up to par. But even if you have a mechanic that you know and trust, it’s nice to know you and your vehicle are protected by a warranty on the off-chance that something does go wrong.</p><p>It’s unfortunate that most people don’t know their rights when it comes to automotive repair. In most cases if a repair is carried out that causes problems to the vehicle or is substandard, a lawsuit should be made within 2 years of the problem occurring, and that is after you have sent a written demand to the repair shop by certified mail within the first 60 days. Even after all that, you are only covered for up to $10,000 – far less than the value of your vehicle.</p><p>As you can see, if your mechanic doesn’t offer a warranty as part of their service and something goes wrong, you could be out of pocket for thousands of dollars, and a claim against implied warranty can take months to settle in court. Avoid the potential hassle and protect your vehicle by always choosing a mechanic that can back up their work with a guarantee – like<a href=#> our own 12,000 mile / 12 month warranty policy</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Are There Mobile Mechanics Near Me?</strong></h2><p>When it comes to finding a mobile mechanic near you there are almost as many different methods as there are mechanics. Google is your best bet at finding a mobile mechanic local to you, but there are a lot of irrelevant results to wade to until you can find exactly what you’re looking for. Even worse, a lot of the top listings and ‘directories’ are for independent brick and mortar workshops that aren’t true mobile mechanics at all!</p><p>&nbsp;There’s a far simpler way to find a local mobile mechanic<a href=#> by using our search function</a> to see if we service your area. Our search engine is linked to our vehicle diagnostic tool so by answered a few simple questions, we can recommend the best solution for your vehicle.</p><p>Keep in mind that choosing the perfect mobile mechanic for you should be based on several factors such as after-service care, customer reviews, and if quotes are provided along with a warranty on parts and repairs. The mobile mechanic you choose should also arrange any parts you need as well as safe disposal of any old parts or fluids as these need to be disposed of according to strict laws and regulations to prevent environmental harm.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Try a Mobile Mechanic Today</strong></h2><p>Hiring a mobile mechanic is the most convenient way to service your car. The next time you’re looking for expert maintenance or repair, consider doing it on your terms, by having a mobile mechanic come to you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7osHTqKWarJmku667waKjnquVp8Oqr8RnmqilX558o7jOoGawoJGpeqq%2FjJpkpqeSnrmmecyemqGZnp6wcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
