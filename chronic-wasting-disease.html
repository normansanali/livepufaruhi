The fact is that zombie deer disease — or Chronic Wasting Disease — is very real and may even pose a threat to humans.</p><h2>What Is Zombie Deer Disease?</h2><p>The textbook name for the degenerative disease affecting deer, elk, moose, and even reindeer, is Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD). It’s a fatal, neurological illness that occurs when a malformed brain protein begins to kill off normal neurons. As brain function deteriorates, an afflicted body can become listless, confused, being drooling, lose weight, and sometimes become aggressive. In short, it kind of makes the afflicted body act like a zombie.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-207527 alt="Cwd Deer Drinking" width=900 height=639 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cwd-deer-drinking.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-207527 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Donald Savoy/Wisconsin DNR</span><span class=caption-body>A skinny, feeble deer with CWD, a zombie-like degenerative brain disease.</span></p><p>Animals can have CWD for over a year before any symptoms arrive and can even die from an unrelated cause before they show any symptoms because of how slowly the disease develops.</p><p>Zombie deer disease spreads through animal contact, feces, or contaminated water or food. As of right now, there is no medicine, treatment, or vaccine to cure or treat Chronic Wasting Disease.</p><p>CWD was <a href=# rel=noopener>first detected</a> in a captive deer in Colorado in the late 1960s and a wild deer in 1981. As of now, it exists in 251 countries and 24 U.S. states — and counting.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-207531 alt="Cdc Cwd Map" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cdc-cwd-map.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-207531 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>CDC</span><span class=caption-body>A CDC map of where cases of Chronic Wasting Disease are prevalent.</span></p><h2>Why CWD Is A Concern Right Now</h2><p>Once Chronic Wasting Disease becomes established in a particular region, the risk remains in the environment for a long time. The disease can be transmitted quickly and even once an infected elk or deer dies, the infected body poses are a risk to other animals that come in contact with the carcass.</p><p>It is sometimes hard to diagnose an animal with CWD because it shares symptoms with other diseases, including a condition as mundane as malnutrition. The difficult nature of diagnosing the illness (especially in wild populations) facilitates its spread, simply because few precautions are taken.</p><p>However, if people keep their eyes out for possibly infected animals in areas heavily populated with deer, they can help to slow the spread. If people take the time to alert local authorities when they see a sickly deer, they can remove them from the area. This lessens the chances of infecting others in the herd — and other animals as well.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-207530 alt="Dead Mule Deer" width=600 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dead-mule-deer.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-207530 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Montana Fire, Wildlife and Parks</span><span class=caption-body>A mule deer dead from zombie deer disease in Montana.</span></p><p>All this sounds terrible and frightening for the deer, but what about humans? Are we safe from this brain disease?</p><p>“If Stephen King could write an infectious disease novel, he would write about prions like this.”</p><h2>The Risk To Humans</h2><p>Firstly, it should be noted there haven’t been any recorded cases of zombie deer disease in humans as of yet. <a href=# rel=noopener>It is unknown</a> whether humans actually can be infected with CWD prions, but then again, people didn’t think mad cow disease would spread to humans, either.</p><p>Experts believe the transmission of CWD to people is definitely something we should be mindful of, however.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-207529 alt="Emaciated Moose" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/emaciated-moose.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-207529 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>PENNY PRESTON/Wyoming Public Media</span><span class=caption-body>An emaciated moose.</span></p><p>“It is probable that human cases of Chronic Wasting Disease associated with consumption with contaminated meat will be documented in the years ahead,” predicted Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “It’s possible the number of human cases will be substantial and will not be isolated events.”</p><p>To be safe, the CDC recommends that hunters avoid shooting animals that look ill and to definitely have the meat tested if they plan to consume meat from a deer in <a href=# rel=noopener>an area</a> where zombie deer disease is active. People should also wear gloves while touching carcasses and limit their exposure to the animal’s organs — especially the brain and spinal cord.</p><h2>Future Prognoses</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-207532 alt="Arkansas Sick Deer" width=800 height=450 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/arkansas-sick-deer.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-207532 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Arkansas Times</span><span class=caption-body>Sick deer in Arkansas.</span></p><p>In order to stop the spread of zombie deer disease, we need a test that can pinpoint the malformed protein or identify precursors. This is especially important because animals can have the disease without exhibiting symptoms. There is also <a href=# rel=noopener>new research</a> that shows a major soil organic matter compound, humic acid, can slow infectivity of the disease.</p><p>“We need to do something different to get ahead of this disease,” <a href=# rel=noopener>urged</a> Jeremy Schefers, Professor at the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine. “And most of those different strategies won’t be successful without the ability to quickly determine if CWD is present or not. A better test is the critical first step.”</p><p>Oddly enough, the protein behind zombie deer disease is closely related to the one behind mad cow disease. Weirder still, the protein is also related to human degenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-207533 alt="Chronic Wasting Disease Elk" width=900 height=439 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/chronic-wasting-disease-elk.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-207533 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>NPS</span><span class=caption-body>A small elk with Chronic Wasting Disease.</span></p><p>Giving Chronic Wasting Disease a trendy nickname like “zombie deer disease” may give people the wrong idea about just how serious it is, but wildlife disease ecologist Krysten Schuler <a href=# rel=noopener>argued</a> that because the disease is “a big problem” she’s glad more people are paying attention and getting informed.</p><p>“Right now, most scientists believe there is a pretty strong ‘species barrier,’ which means that it’s unlikely the disease will jump to a new species,” Schuler assured.</p><p>After this look at the zombie deer disease, find out about <a href=#>the fungus that creates zombie ants</a>, then see the <a href=#>horrifying effects</a> of the zombie drug “krokodil” on the body.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyktNGopaKbXayutMDIp55mnJmosqK%2FxA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
