You want sleepy cuddles and warm embraces between them — you want them to be happy.</p><p><strong>Congratulations young one, you have discovered the magical art of shipping.</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/our-favorite-ships-that-havent-sailed-01.gif alt="Our Favorite Ships That Haven't Sailed 1" width=500 height=281 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In the magical, wonderful, strange world of Tumblr, you find yourself constantly bombarded (in a good way) with fanart and edits of your non-canonical ship, filling a void in your heart. But somehow, this hole is somehow still growing and growing, leading to more and more fanfiction/fanart/headcanons — it’s a cycle,&nbsp;guys, let’s be real. Shipping a couple that isn’t canon is painful — it hurts something deep within your soul.</p><p>And so in order to deal with the raging, disgruntling fact that our ships sTILL ARE NOT HAPPENING (CAN WE PLEASE MAKE THEM HAPPEN), we have compiled a list of some of our favorite ships that are not canon, but that we know exist in a different universe (especially in our browser history).</p><h2><strong>1. Severus Snape and Lily Evans (Harry Potter)</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/our-favorite-ships-that-havent-sailed-01.jpg alt="Our Favorite Ships That Haven't Sailed 1" width=1024 height=605 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“After all this time?” “Always.” It is a true wonder how one simple word can cause so much pain and joy — this was one of the most iconic lines in the entire series, well done J.K..</p><h2><strong>2.&nbsp;Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter (Harry Potter)</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/our-favorite-ships-that-havent-sailed-02.jpg alt="Our Favorite Ships That Haven't Sailed 2" width=991 height=678 sizes="(max-width: 991px) 100vw, 991px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Okay, let’s get real here guys. There was so much unresolved tension between these two, it was sickening. We mean, come on boys, let’s get it together.</p><h2><strong>3. John Watson and Sherlock Holmes (Sherlock)</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/our-favorite-ships-that-havent-sailed-03.jpg alt="Our Favorite Ships That Haven't Sailed 3" width=624 height=352 sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Sometimes the domesticity between these two is unforgivable. Sherlock and Watson manage to make so many things work — it’s a damn shame they’re both very, very oblivious.</p><h2><strong>4. Stiles Stilinksi and Derek Hale (Teen Wolf)</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/our-favorite-ships-that-havent-sailed-04.jpg alt="Our Favorite Ships That Haven't Sailed 4" width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>These guys were onto something within the first few episodes of the show — it’s no wonder everyone wants them to get together. We could create an entire list of Sterek moments alone…</p><h2><strong>5. Regina Mills and Emma Swan (Once Upon A Time)</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/our-favorite-ships-that-havent-sailed-05.jpg alt='ONCE UPON A TIME - "Snow Falls" - At Henry&#39;s urging, Emma convinces Mary Margaret to pay a visit to a comatose John Doe in the hospital and to read to him from the storybook. But Mary Margaret is stunned at the outcome of her visit. Meanwhile, back in the fairytale world, Prince Charming meets Snow White for the first time in a most unexpected way, on "Once Upon a Time," SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 6 (8:00-9:00 p.m., ET) on the ABC Television Network. (ABC/CHRIS HELCERMANAS-BENGE) JENNIFER MORRISON, LANA PARRILLA' width=2560 height=1703 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>These two powerful, strong women definitely seem to both compliment and complicate each other. We don’t know what to do with all the tension either ladies, let’s just hope you resolve it.</p><h2><strong>6.&nbsp;Prince Charming and Captain Hook (Once Upon A Time)</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/our-favorite-ships-that-havent-sailed-06.jpg alt="Our Favorite Ships That Haven't Sailed 6" width=3000 height=2000 sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>They’re constantly fighting and trying to one-up each other — but could it possibly that these two just don’t know how to deal with their deep, undying love for each other? (We can only hope).</p><h2><strong>7. Kirk and Spock (Star Trek)&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/our-favorite-ships-that-havent-sailed-07.jpg alt="Our Favorite Ships That Haven't Sailed 7" width=450 height=269 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>So, in reality, we don’t really seem to care what era we talk about — all forms of Kirk and Spock are destined to belong together because Kirk and Spock are mEANT TO BE TOGETHER IN EVERY SINGLE UNIVERSE, LISTEN TO US.</p><h2><strong>8. Dean Winchester and Castiel (Supernatural)</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/our-favorite-ships-that-havent-sailed-08.jpg alt="Our Favorite Ships That Haven't Sailed 8" width=400 height=225 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Tumblr’s most reblogged ship — and we get it! Dean and Cas are meant to fall in love and save us all from impending doom.</p><h2><strong>9. Phoebe and Joey (Friends)</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/our-favorite-ships-that-havent-sailed-09.jpg alt="Our Favorite Ships That Haven't Sailed 9" width=1920 height=1080 sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>We can’t be the only people still upset that this never fully reached canon-ness (you listening Oxford dictionary?). These two were meant to be so much more — they could have led to the perfect ending to the show — all three couples coming to life.</p><h2><strong>10. Captain America and Bucky Barnes (Captain America)&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/our-favorite-ships-that-havent-sailed-02.gif alt="Our Favorite Ships That Haven't Sailed 2" width=500 height=281 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“I’m with you pal, till the end of the line.” Considering there is a sudden influx of Marvel fans, everyone is continuing to fall in love with the (SUPER OBVIOUS) love between Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes. We’re just waiting for the MCU to make this happen (and not Hydra!Cap), please and thank you!</p><h2><strong>11. Morgan and Garcia (Criminal Minds)</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/our-favorite-ships-that-havent-sailed-10.jpg alt="Our Favorite Ships That Haven't Sailed 10" width=470 height=265 sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“Baby girl.” It’s a real shame this never happened — they definitely had something bubbling underneath all those pet names. And whether or not it would have worked out, we still think it’d be disgustingly cute to see these two try to make each other blush.</p><h2><strong>12. Morgan and Reid (Criminal Minds)</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/our-favorite-ships-that-havent-sailed-11.jpg alt="Our Favorite Ships That Haven't Sailed 11" width=500 height=334 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>But Reid would be so cute! There is so much love underneath their relationship and there have definitely been some moments where they wanted to kiss (don’t deny this!) and we would have loved to see this beautiful love flourish.</p><h2><strong>13. Tony Dinozzo and Ziva David (NCIS)</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/our-favorite-ships-that-havent-sailed-14.jpg alt="Our Favorite Ships That Haven't Sailed 14" width=1024 height=768 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>SPOILER ALERT&nbsp;</strong>So we’re kind of cheating on this one — but hear us out! This show managed to create such a teasing, extended story between these two. And no one can deny the high, high levels of romantic tension between these two. But during the season finale, where it turns out they&nbsp;actually&nbsp;had something, has got to be one of the greatest scenes in television history — hands down.</p><h2><strong>14. Poe Dameron and Finn (Star Wars)</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/our-favorite-ships-that-havent-sailed-12.jpg alt="Our Favorite Ships That Haven't Sailed 12" width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>EVERYONE KNOWS THIS ONE. EVERYONE IS WAITING TO SEE WHERE THIS GOES. EVERYONE KNOWS THEY HAVE FEELINGS FOR EACH OTHER. FINN WORE POE’S JACKET. MAKE THIS CANON.</p><h2><strong>15. Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr (X-Men)</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/our-favorite-ships-that-havent-sailed-13.jpg alt="Our Favorite Ships That Haven't Sailed 13" width=500 height=584 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The X-Men movies sure do know how to make some things super not-heteronormative. Like, in that one scene in X-Men: First Class where Charles was helping Erik move the giant satellite dish (you know that one) — that scene has managed to remain iconic amongst Cherik shippers.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/15-of-our-favorite-ships-that-havent-sailed-02.gif alt="15 Of Our Favorite Ships That Haven't Sailed 2" width=500 height=282 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>We love and respect all ships — but we want to hear what your non-canon OTP is. We also want to know what your favorite moment between them is.&nbsp;Tweet us @CelebMix and let us know what yours is!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kfnZ5xZqtqKqZqbJuv8eip6xlmJbDprrTZqqaoZyasXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
