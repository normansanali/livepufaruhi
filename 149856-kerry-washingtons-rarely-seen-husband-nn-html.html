Kerry slayed in her Tory Burch creation, a voluminous peach gown which had the words “Negativity is Noise” scrawled across it.</p><p class=dh>Nnamdi wore a blue tuxedo and looked dapper standing next to his wife as they posed for photos alongside other guests that night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/e935df63ef868eeb7f5959dbf545601d1783301557455557.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Kerry Washington and husband Nnamdi Asomugha are joined by Edward Enninful, Ella Balinska, Hikari Mori, Stefano Tonchi and Tory Burch attend The 2019 Met Gala in New York City on May 6, 2019.</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>ELUSIVE IN PHOTOS</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>This is not the first time Kerry attended the event with Nnamdi, an actor and former NFL player, who also joined her at last year’s gala though they skipped the photo ops together. Instead, Kerry posed solo wearing Ralph Lauren.</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>KEEPING THINGS PRIVATE</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>The “Scandal” star is known to keep her personal life private and that includes avoiding tabloid presence. Her Idaho wedding to Nnamdi was an extremely private affair and she never announced her pregnancies or the birth of their two children.</p><p class=dh>Knowing this, it was a surprise when a photo of a family outing in Nigeria <a class="me a" href=#>made it to the news</a> recently. They attended the 70th birthday of Nnamdi’s mother and a family pic including extended relatives was featured in a Nigerian magazine and shared on Twitter. The couple’s children, Isabelle and Caleb were visible in the pic where everyone wore traditional Nigerian outfits.</p><p class=dh>It’s unclear how Kerry reacted to the spread of that photo but if it were her famous character Olivia Pope, she probably would have found a way to shut it down.</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>ANOTHER SURPRISE MET GALA APPEARANCE</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Also <a class="me a" href=#>making a surprise appearance together</a> at the MET Gala was longtime rumored couple Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes. The pair arrived separately but posed for photos together in coordinated outfits.</p><p class=dh>The low-key couple has been more at ease lately in flaunting their unconfirmed relationship to the public. The last time they attended an event together was in January last year at a pre-Grammy party.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmprcnBla3qssdGrsGavkai1qrrGraanq12nrrOxy7JkrJ2Vo3qpwdKbmKecXaO7b7TTpqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
