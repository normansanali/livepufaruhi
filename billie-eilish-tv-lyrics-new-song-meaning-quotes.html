The singer released “TV” and “The 30th” on July 21, 2022, under an LP called Guitar Songs. Scroll to see our lyric breakdown for both equally very sad songs.</p><h2>Billie Eilish Song ‘TV’ Lyric Breakdown</h2><p>Billie originally sang her new track “TV” with her brother and collaborator&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=1><strong>FINNEAS</strong></a>, to a crowd a the OA Arena on June 7, 2022. “TV” includes references to the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the defamation trial between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard and more.&nbsp;“TV” also describes the reality of losing friends, fighting with your significant other and feeling utterly hopeless as the television plays depressing news in the background. A real uplifter.</p><p>The melancholic ballad begins with a guitar strumming a soft, eerie tune until Billie joins in with her soft vocals. “I don’t want to talk right now, I just want to watch TV.&nbsp; I’ll stay in the pool and drown, so I don’t have to watch you leave.”</p><p>“I’ll put on&nbsp;<i>Survivor&nbsp;</i>just to watch somebody suffer,” she sings in the first verse, while in the second verse, she adds: “Did you see me on TV? I’ll try not to starve myself just because you’re mad at me.” The Grammy-winning singer also mentions how falling in love has doomed her friendships. “All of my friends are missing again, that’s what happens when you fall in love. You don’t have the time, you leave them all behind,” she croons. “You tell yourself it’s fine, you’re just in love.”</p><h2>Billie Song ‘The 30th’ Lyric Breakdown</h2><p>In a July 2022 interview with&nbsp;<strong>Zane Lowe</strong>, Billie stated that “The 30th” was the first song she and FINNEAS wrote since her last album&nbsp;Happier Than Ever.&nbsp;The song is in Billie’s point of view as she watches someone she loves experience a horrific accident which they may never be the same because of it.</p><p>“Sometimes, you look the same / Just like you did before the accident / When you’re starin’ into space,” Billie sings. “It’s hard to believe you don’t remember it / Woke up in the ambulance / You pieced it all together on the drive.”</p><p>During the bridge, Billie asks hypothetical questions to the person who was in the accident. “What if it happened to you on a different day? On a bridge where there wasn’t a rail in the way? Or a neighborhood street where the little kids play?&nbsp;<span class="x_ReferentFragmentdesktop__Highlight-sc-110r0d9-1 x_jAzSMw">Or the Angeles Crest in the snow or the rain?” She sings. “If&nbsp;</span><span class="x_ReferentFragmentdesktop__Highlight-sc-110r0d9-1 x_jAzSMw"><span class="x_ReferentFragmentdesktop__Highlight-sc-110r0d9-1 x_crMtSN">you changed anything, would you not have survived?</span><span class="x_ReferentFragmentdesktop__Highlight-sc-110r0d9-1 x_crMtSN"><br aria-hidden=true></span><span class="x_ReferentFragmentdesktop__Highlight-sc-110r0d9-1 x_crMtSN">You’re alive, you’re alive, you’re alive.”</span></span></p><p></p><h2>Billie Eilish ‘TV’ and ‘The 30th’ Song Meanings</h2><p>“TV” is Billie’s most politically charged song to date. She refers to what attracts society’s attention: movie stars fighting rather than an indictment affecting half of the nation’s population. “The internet’s gone wild watching movie stars on trial/While they’re overturning Roe v. Wade,” she sings. “Maybe I’m the problem.”</p><p>Billie’s second song “The 30th,” was written due to something that happened to the singer on November 30. “That’s why it’s called ‘The 30th,’ because something happened on November 30th and it had just been the most indescribable thing to have to witness and experience,” she explained in her interview with Zane Lowe.</p><p>“I had been writing down all these thoughts that I was having. I was with Finneas, and I was like, “I’m sorry, I don’t know what you were planning on doing, but we need to write this song about this right now, and we did, and that was the first song we wrote since&nbsp;Happier Than Ever.”</p><p>Love J-14?
