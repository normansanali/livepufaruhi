Although they would love to have his services, he, however, cannot help them due to his injury. Etsebeth had been nursing a broken hand, an injury he acquired after the Lions defeated his team at Ellis Park. During the game, this skilled rugby player was seen seeking treatment for his arms. Later on, just shortly half-time, Etsebeth was seen with his hand strapped.</p><p>The player did not even show up for the second stanza of the game. Initially, the commentators of SuperSport announced that the injured player had broken his ankle. However, it seemed to be a wrong diagnosis since his ankle was alright, but his arm was not. Although Etzebeth has a very public career, he, however, is not very forthcoming with his personal life. He has not revealed to the media whom he is currently dating or has married, making most of his fans assume that he is single.</p><p>Despite these assumptions, we can, however, state the fact that Etsebeth is a very skilled lock player. Fans are sad that he cannot help the Stormers in the 2019 Super Rugby due to his arm injury. However, they are praying for his quick recovery.</p><h2 id=firstHeading class=firstHeading><span class=ez-toc-section id=eben-etzebeth-contract></span><span>Eben Etzebeth Contract</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Etzebeth, who has 75 Springbok caps, signed a two-year contract with the Top 14 outfit, and 2015 Rugby World Cup winner Milner-Skudder will feature for the side for three seasons.</p><p>According to Toulon’s official website, Etzebeth will join the French club at the end of the World Cup in Japan next year.

He was awarded the Man of the Match award as Province gained revenge on the Sharks with a 25–18 win in Durban.</p><p>Top 14 side Toulon reported Etzebeth would join them after the 2019 Rugby World Cup in December 2018.
