Having been in the entertainment business since he was a kid, Bow has been around the industry for nearly his entire life.&nbsp;With&nbsp;G6&nbsp;set for a release on May 21, it will be intriguing to see how Bow Wow adapts to the next chapter&nbsp;in his career. Not shying away from a topic that most people would avoid, Shad spoke to Genius about the use of ghostwriters and, in particular, who has written for him along the course of his trajectory.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Not dancing around the topic, the interviewer goes straight into asking who has written for Bow Wow over the years, to which the star honestly responds. "<a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kurupt</a> wrote my first song ever." Bow continued, "[Da] Brat, [Jermaine Durpi] of course, my man Slim from Queens."&nbsp;The rapper noted that, while he was hosting 106 & Park in New York, he was so busy that he didn't have time to get into the studio. In turn, he called <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jadakiss</a> to write about ten songs for him. Before closing out his sentence, he remembered that <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>T.I.</a> has also worked a lot with him, apologetically stating, "How could I forget Tip?"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">With the many commitments that Bow Wow has had in his career, it is no surprise to hear that others have helped him with the writing process. Bow Wow's first songwriting experience came with "Basketball," he revealed, unreluctantly sharing details that many other artists would decline to speak of. Check out the full video below and take a guess at the "big dog" Bow Wow mentions that has been prominently using ghostwriters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhZ4BxhZBmmaivXay8uHnRnq2emZyoeqi0zqyrsKqZqbKzv4yhnGagkah6uLvRpJydZaeewal5zq%2Bcq2WknbJuxcSaqaxlnprEtA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
