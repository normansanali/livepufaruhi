That show, which ran on ABC from 1964 to 1972, took the domestic situation comedy and turned it on its head by focusing on mortal advertising exec Darrin Stephens (first <strong>Dick York</strong>, then <strong>Dick Sargent</strong>) who falls in love with and marries Samantha (<strong><a href=#>Elizabeth Montgomery</a></strong>), who turns out to be a witch. What follows is their attempt to live a normal life despite her extraordinary abilities and&nbsp;her magical family member — in particular her interfering mother, Endora (<strong>Agnes Moorehead</strong>).</p><p>In some ways it sounds like a concept that would have a limited shelf life (one could say the same thing about&nbsp;<a href=#>My Favorite Martian</a>, <a href=#>Mister Ed</a>&nbsp;or even&nbsp;<a href=#>Gilligan’s Island</a>), but the show spanned a total of eight seasons and delighted audiences. A major part of its appeal came from the cast that brought the show to life week to week, not just the regulars. Just consider <strong><a href=#>Paul Lynde</a></strong>, who played Samantha’s punny Uncle Arthur and who, while only&nbsp;appearing in a total of 11 episodes, had a presence so strong that people believe that he was actually a regular.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bewitched-cast-main-2-1.jpg><p>As we’ve done before with&nbsp;<a href=#>Father Knows Best</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>The Addams Family</a>, we’re taking an up close look at the cast of&nbsp;Bewitched&nbsp;before, during and after the show. In this case we’re enlisting TV historians <a href=#><strong>Herbie J Pilato</strong></a> and <strong>Ed Robertson</strong>. Herbie is the host of the streaming Amazon/Shout Factory Classic TV Talk Show <a href=#>Then Again With Herbie J Pilato, </a>and&nbsp;author of the books Twitch Upon a Star: The Bewitched Life and Career of Elizabeth Montgomery, The Essential Elizabeth Montgomery: A Guide to Her Magical Performances and&nbsp;Bewitched Forever, all of which can be <a href=#>ordered from him directly</a>.
