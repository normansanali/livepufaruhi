They are thrilled to be expanding their little family once again.</p><p>“Miranda, Evan, Flynn, and Hart are looking forward to welcoming the newest member to their family,” Kerr’s rep shared with the Daily Mail.</p><p>Along with the happy couple enjoying like with their baby boy Hart, they share custody of Kerr’s 8-year-old son Flyyn, whose father is her ex-husband Orlando Bloom.&nbsp; Kerr and Spiegel are proud of their blended family and can’t wait to add another little one to their bliss.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BvpPYtWhnfb/</p><p>The 35-year-old brunette beauty and her 28-year-old husband were married in May 2017 in a very intimate, as well as private ceremony in the backyard of their Brentwood home. Kerr said it was her dream wedding, especially since she collaborated with Dior’s Maria Grazia Chiuri to create her gorgeous dress.</p><p>“I think it’s ever a girl’s dream to have Dior design her wedding dress. I thought, ‘If she’s up for it, I’m up for it.’ Honestly, I couldn’t have imagined a more beautiful wedding dress,” exclaimed Kerr to Vogue magazine days after she returned from her honeymoon.</p><p>One year later they welcomed their beautiful baby boy Hart. On May 7, 2018, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, Kerr became a mother of two sons. She is a devoted mother, who works hard to shield her boys from the public eye. Kerr rarely, if ever, posts pictures of her sons on social media. Bloom and Spiegel also keep their kids out of the spotlight. It is a family effort.</p><p></p><p>Not long after news broke that Miranda Kerr and her husband Evan Spiegel were expecting their second child together, the supermodel shared a picture of her growing bump on social media. She did not say anything about her pregnancy, Kerr just held her baby bump and shared a few emoji to document the picture.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>It is going to be quite the year of changes for Flynn Bloom. His mother, Kerr, is having another baby and his father, Bloom, is going to marry his long-time girlfriend singer, Katy Perry. The blended family is getting bigger, which is precisely what Bloom and Ker wanted for their son, to surround him with people that love him in both of his households.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGednr%2BiusOaZKSdoqd6sb7EoKWapqRisrm8xJyroqaXYsCmr86nm2abmJ65pXnWoquhZZiqwKOtzZ1knq6Ro3q0vMienp6kXWeDdIKQbmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
