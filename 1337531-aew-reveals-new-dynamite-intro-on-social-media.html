Several top AEW stars are featured such as Chris Jericho, The Elite, Britt Baker, Bryan Danielson, Saraya, and MJF, among others.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here is an EXCLUSIVE look at the new <a href=#>#AEWDynamite</a> intro!</p><p>Don't miss the first <a href=#>#AEWDynamite</a> of 2023 LIVE TOMORROW from Seattle’s <a href=#>@ClimateArena</a> at 8pm ET / 7pm CT on <a href=#>@TBSNetwork</a>! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UGyPn2cU1D</a></p><p>— All Elite Wrestling (@AEW) <a href=#>January 3, 2023</a></p><p>Tony Khan previously confirmed the new set design when hyping up the changes we would see at the start of 2023 in an interview with <a href=#>TV Insider</a>.</p><p>“I don’t want to let the cat out of the bag necessarily, especially so close to the big day. But at the start of 2023, we’re going to open the year on Wednesday, January 4 with the first Dynamite in Seattle, marking a full year of Dynamite on TBS. We’ll definitely have a new look, to say the least. I’m excited about it,” Khan said. “I think it’s a nice thing to present to the fans, but frankly, I’ve found more so than ever, the more you talk about these things.</p><p>“When you build them up, you don’t want to create expectations that are impossible. I will say the set will be beautiful though. The look of Rampage will also be different. This will affect the way people view AEW on Wednesdays and Fridays in terms of presentation with the set and the show with the same great action.”</p><p>Khan also spoke about the importance of hiring Mike Mansury as a new Senior Vice President and Co-Executive Producer.</p><p>“Mike just started with us and is a huge acquisition for AEW. He has so much knowledge in TV production,” Tony Khan said. “To have him join us as a co-executive producer and senior production executive is really great for us. It’s so important to have someone with his experience. Right now he is evaluating things in terms of presentation. I’m excited about what he will add to AEW.”</p><p>WrestleZone will have coverage of AEW Dynamite as it airs on Wednesday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJsbm5rYWKupsOMq5yvnZGhwG66xLBknbGelrqqwMRmoKesoqR6sLqMrKacoZGheq6xw6KY</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
