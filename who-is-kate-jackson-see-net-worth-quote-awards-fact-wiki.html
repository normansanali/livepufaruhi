She is an actress, producer and director, perhaps still best known for playing Sabrina Duncan in the original ’70s series “Charlies Angels” and Amanda King in the 80s series “Scarecrow and Mrs. King”.</p><p>So just how wealthy is Kate Jackson? It has been reported that Jackson has earned a net worth of over $10 million, as of early 2016. Her wealth has been established through her numerous television appearances during her long career as an actress.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=kate-jackson-net-worth-10-million></span>Kate Jackson Net Worth $10 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jackson attended The Brooke Hill School for Girls in Mountain Brook, Alabama. Upon matriculating she enrolled in the University of Mississippi, but eventually transferred to New York’s American Academy of Dramatic Arts to study acting. She started to work as a tour guide at NBC while also doing summer stock at the Stowe Playhouse in Stove, Vermont.</p><p>Jackson’s television break came with the 1960 Gothic soap opera “Dark Shadows”, where she had a supporting role as a ghost Daphne Harridge. She went on to make several guest appearances in ’60s television films and series. In 1972 she appeared in the crime series “The Rookies”, playing the nurse Jill Danko. The same year she took part in the indie film “Limbo” and went on to appear in several television films. Meanwhile, she studied directing and editing.</p><p>Prior to “The Rookies” cancellation in 1976, the show’s producers Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg offered Jackson a role in another series “The Alley Cats”. The title was soon changed to Jackson’s title suggestion “Charlie’s Angels”; it involves three women working in a private detective agency, with Jackson playing one of them, Sabrina Duncan. The series became highly popular and Jackson won rave reviews for her performance. Her reputation in the Hollywood scene rose and her net worth was boosted. The series enabled her to appear on the front cover of Time Magazine, along with her two co-stars Farrah Fawcett-Majors and Jaclyn Smith. When the third season of “Charlie’s Angels” ended, Jackson left the series.</p><p>After appearing in several TV movies, in 1982 Jackson starred in the movie “Making Love”, the first mainstream Hollywood movie to deal with homosexuality. In 1983 she took the leading role of a divorced housewife and secret agent Amanda King in the CBS series “Scarecrow and Mrs. King” – she was also one of the show’s producers, having her own production company Shoot the Moon Enterprises. The series was highly praised and significantly contributed to Jackson’s wealth. It ended in 1987.</p><p>The following year Jackson starred in the sitcom “Baby Boom” and in 1989 she appeared in the comedy film “Loverboy”. She went on to appear in a number of television movies of the 90s, including “The Stranger Within”, “Quiet Killer”, “Empty Cradle” and “Armed and Innocent”, as well as in several TV series such as “Ally McBeal”, “Dead Man’s Gun” and “Twice in a Lifetime”.</p><p>During the 2000s, Jackson appeared in the movies “Larceny” and “No Regrets” and also continued to take roles in numerous TV movies and series. She appeared as a guest judge in Jaclyn Smith’s reality series “Shear Genius”, too, in 2008.</p><p>Her memoir “The Smart One” has been re-scheduled for release in 2020.</p><p>Jackson has appeared in around 40 films and 20 series, which has enabled her to enter Hollywood stardom and establish an appreciable fortune.</p><p>In her personal life, Jackson has married three times, firstly to actor and producer Andrew Stevens from 1978 to 1982. In 1982 she married David Greenwald, and they divorced after two years. She then married stuntman Tom Hart in 1991, and divorced him in 1993. In 1995 Jackson adopted a son. Her current relationship status is unknown.</p><p>The actress battled with breast cancer in 1987 and 1989. She also underwent open heart surgery in 1995 due to a small hole in her heart. She shared her experience to increase the awareness of these issues, and in 2003 received the Power of Love award by the American Heart Association.</p><p>In 2010 Jackson filed a suit against Richard B. Francis, her then financial advisor, accusing him of bringing her to financial ruin, as his acts cost her more than $3 million. Their eventual agreement is unknown to the public.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Kate Jackson</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 29, 1948</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Birmingham, Alabama USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.75&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress, director, producer</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>The Brooke Hill School for Girls in Mountain Brook, Alabama, New York’s American Academy of Dramatic Arts</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Andrew Stevens (1978-1982), David Greenwald (1982-1984), Tom Hart (1991-1993)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Charles Taylor</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Ruth, Hogan Jackson</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Jenny Jackson</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/Ultimate-Kate-Jackson-273085406081617/</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>https://twitter.com/katejacksonwm</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>www.imdb.com/name/nm0000462</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Germany’s Bravo Golden Otto Award for Best Female TV Star three times (1986–88),Power of Love award by the American Heart Association (2003)</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>The Long Blondes</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Emmy Awards, Golden Globe Awards</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>“Charlies Angels”, “Scarecrow and Mrs. King”, Kramer vs Kramer (1979), Making Love (1982), Loverboy (1989), Quiet Killer (1992), “Limbo”, Empty Cradle (1993), Satan’s School for Girls (2000)</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Saturday Night Live” (1979), Charlie’s Angels (1976), “Baby Boom” (1988),”Shear Genius” (2008), “The Rookies”(1972-1976), “A Kidnapping in the Family” (1996), “Twice in a Lifetime” (1999), “Family Guy” (2006)</td></tr></table><table class=quotes><tr><th>Quote</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>[In 2009, a day after Farrah Fawcett died] When the first year of “Charlie’s Angels” ended, our friendship didn’t. It just grew stronger and closer through the years. I don’t know what the connection that the three of us have is, but it is there, and it is something extremely special. I think that is the reason the show worked. I think it’s even better than the movies because we truly cared about each other and still do. It was a pleasure and a privilege.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>When you think about “Charlie’s Angels,” you think about three specific people. You think about Farrah Fawcett, and Jaclyn Smith, and me. So the only problem with the Charlie’s Angels (2000) movie might be, Charlie’s Angels aren’t in it.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>[talking about the film versions of Charlie’s Angels (1976)] I think they missed the mark. In the TV show, Farrah [Farrah Fawcett], Jaclyn [Jaclyn Smith] and I were best friends who cared for each other and I think that came through in the acting. In the movies, they were too busy competing with each other, trying to see who could jump the highest or wear the tightest clothes.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>I’d rather share the glory of a hit than star by myself in a flop.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>[on her Charlie’s Angels (1976) days] It was good when it was good . . . and when it wasn’t good, it was bad.</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>She had developed an unfair reputation for being difficult on “Charlie’s Angels” (1976). The truth was she was strong and protective towards her costars Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith and frequently stopped the producers from overworking them. They had wanted the three actresses to give up their lunch hour to pose for “Time” magazine cover in 1976, and both Farrah and Jaclyn were willing, since they deemed it a prestigious honor, but Kate saw it as one more way for the producers to encroach on their personal time. She locked herself in with her trailer with Farrah and Jaclyn and told the producers that the door was stuck and won’t open. The three had their lunch for 45 minutes, when the producers struggled to open the door and begged them to pose for “Time” magazine, which they did in the last 15 minutes of their lunch hour.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>She had seen her “Charlie’s Angels” 1976) co-stars long before they were cast in the hit show. When she first came to Hollywood, she saw Farrah Fawcett at a party and thought that if all girls in Hollywood were as beautiful as her, she didn’t have a chance and might as well go home to Alabama. Luckily, she stayed and became a star. She met Jaclyn Smith at an audition for another show and they became friends. Jaclyn and Farrah had worked together before on a Max Factor commercial and they knew each other. But it was “Charlie’s Angels” that put all three of them together in the same room for the first time, and they became close friends, a friendship that lasted for many decades.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>She was the only “Angel” to be nominated for an Emmy during the run of the Charlie’s Angels (1976). In fact, she and fellow cast member David Doyle were the only cast members to receive nominations.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>The German magazine “Bravo” awarded Kate Jackson a Golden Otto in 1986, 1987 and 1988 for her excellence as a TV actress in Scarecrow and Mrs. King (or at titled in Germany “Agentin mit Herz”).</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Her acting mentor was Gerald S. O’Loughlin.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>In May 2010, Jackson filed a lawsuit against her financial advisor, Richard B. Francis, claiming his actions cost Jackson more than $3 million and brought her to financial ruin. In December 2010, the parties reached an undisclosed settlement.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>One of the few Dark Shadows regulars to appear in “Night of Dark Shadows,” the last of the Dark Shadows movies, which was actually made after the series was canceled.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Godmother to Spencer Margaret Richmond(born in 1985), the daughter of her Charlie’s Angels costar, Jaclyn Smith. When she adopted her son Charles Taylor Jackson (born in 1995), Smith became his godmother.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Her breakout roles in the Dark Shadows franchise led to a series of lead casting in the horror/thriller genre, where directors began to dub her “the brunette Carol Lynley” who up to that point had been the leading actress to appear in typecast roles of terrified women in the television horror productions that flourished during the late ’60s and early ’70s.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Attended University of Mississippi but left without graduating.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Worked in both the original Satan’s School for Girls (1973) and the remake (Satan’s School for Girls (2000)).</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Is a sister of Kappa Kappa Gamma.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Was offered a cameo in the film version of Charlie’s Angels (2000). Negotiations fell through after she insisted on playing the villainous role that was eventually played by Kelly Lynch.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>In addition to being the first Angel to be cast in Charlie’s Angels (1976), she was also responsible for coming up with the show’s name.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Former daughter-in-law of Stella Stevens.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Began professional modeling at age 16.</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>1987: Had her long, shapely legs insured for $8 million.</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Was discovered by Paramount Studios head Robert Evans, who was struck by her 1940s Hollywood looks.</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>She has three Emmy and four Golden Globes nominations, an award of excellence from the UCLA drama department and two Humanitarian Awards for her work with children and animals.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>She is a former Max Factor and Revlon model.</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Ranked #18 in FHM’s 100 sexiest women of all time.</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Has survived two battles with breast cancer. Once in 1987, and again in 1989. After a partial mastectomy and radiation, she won her fight and shared her experience to highlight the importance of mammograms.</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>1995: A tearful Kate approached Rosie O’Donnell at a party at her Loverboy (1989) costar Carrie Fisher’s house, because Rosie had just adopted a son, while Kate had spent the past five years searching for a child. Rosie, who had never met her before, was eager to help. She said, “You’re in luck. That day I got a call from a lawyer who had an [expensive] adoption because of the mother’s lack of health insurance or whatnot. He asked if I knew anyone who was well-off.” Within weeks, Kate brought home her son Taylor.</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>Had to turn down the Meryl Streep role in Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) because of scheduling conflicts with Charlie’s Angels (1976). This eventually prompted the actress to leave the TV series.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Listed as one of twelve “Promising New Actors of 1972” in John Willis’ Screen World, Vol. 34.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head><span class=ez-toc-section id=actress></span>Actress <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><table class=actress><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Criminal Minds</td><td>2007</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Ambassador Elizabeth Prentiss</td></tr><tr><td>A Daughter’s Conviction</td><td>2006</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Maureen Hansen</td></tr><tr><td>Family Guy</td><td>2006</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Mrs. Amanda King</td></tr><tr><td>No Regrets</td><td>2004</td><td>Suzanne Kennerly</td></tr><tr><td>Third Watch</td><td>2004</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Jan Martin</td></tr><tr><td>Larceny</td><td>2004</td><td>Mom</td></tr><tr><td>Miracle Dogs</td><td>2003</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Terri Logan</td></tr><tr><td>Sabrina, the Teenage Witch</td><td>2002</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Candy</td></tr><tr><td>The Zeta Project</td><td>2002</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Bombshell</td></tr><tr><td>A Mother’s Testimony</td><td>2001</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Sharon Carlson</td></tr><tr><td>Satan’s School for Girls</td><td>2000</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>The Dean</td></tr><tr><td>Chicken Soup for the Soul</td><td>2000</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Professor Foley</td></tr><tr><td>Batman Beyond</td><td>1999</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Bombshell</td></tr><tr><td>Twice in a Lifetime</td><td>1999</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Julie Smith / Mildred</td></tr><tr><td>Error in Judgment</td><td>1999</td><td>Shelley</td></tr><tr><td>Sweet Deception</td><td>1998</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Kit Gallagher</td></tr><tr><td>Dead Man’s Gun</td><td>1997</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Katherine Morrison</td></tr><tr><td>Ally McBeal</td><td>1997</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Barbara Cooker</td></tr><tr><td>What Happened to Bobby Earl?</td><td>1997</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Rose Earl</td></tr><tr><td>Panic in the Skies!</td><td>1996</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Laurie Ann Pickett</td></tr><tr><td>A Kidnapping in the Family</td><td>1996</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>DeDe Cooper</td></tr><tr><td>The Cold Heart of a Killer</td><td>1996</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Jessie Arnold</td></tr><tr><td>The Silence of Adultery</td><td>1995</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Dr. Rachel Lindsey</td></tr><tr><td>Justice in a Small Town</td><td>1994</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Sandra Clayton</td></tr><tr><td>Armed and Innocent</td><td>1994</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Patsy Holland</td></tr><tr><td>Arly Hanks</td><td>1993</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Arly hanks</td></tr><tr><td>Empty Cradle</td><td>1993</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Rita Donohue</td></tr><tr><td>Adrift</td><td>1993</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Katie Nast</td></tr><tr><td>Homewrecker</td><td>1992</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Lucy (voice)</td></tr><tr><td>Quiet Killer</td><td>1992</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Dr. Nora Hart</td></tr><tr><td>The Boys of Twilight</td><td>1992</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Miss Dutton</td></tr><tr><td>The Stranger Within</td><td>1990</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Mare Blackburn</td></tr><tr><td>Loverboy</td><td>1989</td><td>Diane Bodek</td></tr><tr><td>Baby Boom</td><td>1988-1989</td><td>TV Series</td><td>J.C.
