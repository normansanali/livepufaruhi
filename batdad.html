And on a fine day of March 2019, the news of the couple's separation was revealed. It was a great shock for their fans. The news was confirmed by Blake when asked by his fans. Many fans asked about their separation. Some fans even wrote: <i>"You and Jen are done?! Oh, I'm so sorry. Glad you're trying to make friendship happen, though." </i>Another added: "<i>Sorry about you and Jen. She totes cracks me up — you and your wonderful kids do too lol!".</i></p><p>And BatDad replied:<i> "Nada, still friends though!

They even co-parent their children for their sake. In an <a href=# rel=nofollow>interview with Today, BatDad</a> said: <i>"I know I can be annoying.

Reading what they’re feeling. Being able to recognize the signals and knowing when your partner needs a little more help than normal. That’s huge when you’re raising a family.”</i></p><p>The aforementioned interview suggests that the reason for their divorce was the annoying process of making the vines. But, that was funny for us.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, the actual reason for their divorce is still a mystery.&nbsp;</p><h2>Rise To Popularity And Net Worth</h2><p>As I mentioned above, BatDad aka Blake Wilson&nbsp;started out as a Viner.
