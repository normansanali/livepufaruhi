It wouldn't be far-fetched to assume that the late tattoo artist's fellow cast members are still reeling from the shock. Ryan Henry seems to have been affected the most. Soon after his passing in early February, he had posted a now-deleted video with a heartfelt note that reflected the bond he shared with Fly.</p><p>Also known as Elijah Muhammad-Bey, Fly landed a recurring role in 'Black Ink Crew: Chicago' where he worked with Charmaine Walker at 2nd City Ink. During his time on the show, he would usually mind his own business and get work done, which made him likable. But soon after Season 6 concluded, unlike his counterparts, he was not much to be seen or heard of. Fly would occasionally upload content on social media but there was no way to know what he was up to off of it, which brings us to the next question: Did he film for one of the specials VH1 has planned across March through mid-April? More on that in a bit.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=#>Was Fly Tatted murdered? 'Black Ink Crew' star's death was homicide not suicide, reveals castmate Ryan Henry</a><br><a href=# rel>'Black Ink Crew: Chicago': Ryan is coming out as a hero against Charmaine, fans think she is twisting Fly's words</a></p><p>The network will be releasing a string of episodes ahead of 'Black Ink Crew: New York' Season 9 premiere on April 19. 'Black Ink Crew: Secrets Unlocked', hosted by Eva Marcille, can be dubbed as a faux reunion special where cast members from across the franchise will get together for a virtual tell-all chat. There'll be secrets and gossips involved, a press release confirmed and added that there'll be "surprise guests." Will Fly be one of them? If yes, this would be his final appearance for 'BIC'.</p><p>At this point, this is speculation. There's been no official word on when the specials were filmed. In any case, even if the cameras were up after Fly's passing, we are hoping there will at least be a segment where the stars pay their tributes to the late ink artist.</p><p>Fly's death was tragic and controversial in equal measure. At first, it was reported as a suicide but as the investigation progressed, officials allegedly ruled it as a homicide. What's more, his girlfriend Bella Tatted found herself neck-deep in disturbing allegations that claimed she had a role to play in his death.</p><p>Addressing the rumors, she posted an <a href=# rel=nofollow>emotional clip</a>, in which she explained how things have been at her end. "I don’t even care what y’all saying about me. I don’t even care that y’all calling me these names, and murderer. All I care about is him and his family,” Bella said tearfully and added: “He didn’t mean to do it. Y’all didn’t see what I seen."</p><p>'Black Ink Crew: Secrets Unlocked' parts one and two will air on March 15 and March 22 at 9/8c on VH1.
