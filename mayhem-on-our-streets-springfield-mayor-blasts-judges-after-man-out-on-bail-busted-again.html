Sarno said the arrests prove the need for bail reform to stop the "mayhem in our streets."&nbsp;In a lengthy <a href=#><strong>Facebook post</strong></a>, Sarno blamed judges for propping up a "broken system" that allows for "revolving doors" at prisons.&nbsp;</p>With the rearrests of two repeat violent criminal offenders on gun charges, one who was out on bail with firearm and heroin drug dealing charges in both Hampden and Hampshire counties, and another who was out with numerous active warrants, shows that our courts and some of our judges continue to perpetuate a broken system that shows complete disregard to our residents and business community by allowing these repeat violent criminal offenders, again and again, out through their ‘revolving door’ to continue to create mayhem on our streets and in our neighborhoods. While these two repeat criminal offenders were joy riding around, Police Superintendent Cheryl Clapprood and I spent Friday speaking with residents and property owners affected by gun violence and shootings in their neighborhoods. Not only did we update them on the Springfield Police Departments continued and ongoing efforts, which they acknowledged and appreciated, but also the issue of why the courts and some judges allow this to happen. This has to stop! I again want to thank State Representative Angelo Puppolo for continuing to file my bail reform legislation, and District Attorney Anthony Gulluni and Sheriff Nick Cocchi for their continued partnership in this quest to keep our residents and business community safe and sound – we’ll keep fighting.<p class=e-click-here-follow-btn data-testid=bottom-paragraph><a class=e-email-signup js-follow-button data-testid=article-click-here-to-subscribe href=#>Click here</a> to follow Daily Voice Hampden and receive free news updates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmickZ65usLOopqeZpOkunC5wKyqmpuYqsCmwNOsZqGZnaWxprqOqaaloZOaeqe10Z5mppmpnbKuec6nZKitomLAtb7EnqusZaOlv6q6xp%2BgnqSUYrqixc6rZJukkajBtHnJrpugnaNirqfAxKtkppmeYry2wIyopWaakZ65bq7UrKuenF2WtKK1zWhvbm5laX1w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
