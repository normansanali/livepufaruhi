In the docs, obtained by TMZ, Tammy says she wants Darius to ‘attend alcohol/drug abuse and batterers’ intervention classes.’</p><p>She wants his visitation rights cut off until the ‘Family Matters’ star provides proof he’s completed a treatment program.”</p><p>It was just a few weeks ago that Tammy accused Darius of holding their daughter over a pot of boiling hot water when the 1-year-old was an infant. “Yea, right,” <a href=#>Darius responded to such allegations</a>. “Sad some people will do ANYTHING [to] make #TMZ,” he added.</p><p>Tammy also responded to the news and Darius’ denial by telling her social media followers, “I have no reason to lie on ANYONE about ANYTHING. And trust and believe, I DID NOT contact the media. I haven’t posted ONE thing about these matters on social media as I’ve tried to handle it privately and gracefully.” She also revealed, “The guilty always respond guilty.”</p><p>Zoey is Darius McCrary and Tammy Brawner’s only child together. Darius also has a son from a previous relationship.</p><p><strong>See how Zoey celebrates her 17-month-old milestone below!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kHBmaWtfZoFwsMCroK6rXaKwpL7Aq7CsZaees6Z5xaKjnqtdm7yzecOiraiqk5p6uK3Nrapmq5%2Bhsm6v1KyrqJypYrynecOarKCgpJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
