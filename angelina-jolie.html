Appearances in music videos for the Rolling Stones and Lenny Kravitz led to small film parts, and in 1995 she landed her first starring role in cyber-thriller .<br></p><h2>Angelina Jolie's Career and Success</h2><p id=e0atWUueoO data-wc=62>Jolie's star rose significantly when she picked up two consecutive Golden Globe Awards for her performances in TNT's 1997 film and HBO's 1998 film . A year later, she received the highest acclaim of her career when she played the sociopathic patient Lisa in 1999's opposite Winona Ryder, which won her the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.</p><p id=e73EuoSlWrr data-wc=71>The aughts and 2010s were a prosperous period for the star, where she cemented herself as one of the world's highest paid actresses thanks to the films (2001), (2005), (2007), (2008), and (2008), which earned her a second Oscar nomination.

After a 2001 visit to Cambodia while filming Lara Croft opened her eyes to the refugee crisis, she began undertaking field missions on an infrequent basis.</p><p id=eNF8zQIVsJ data-wc=50>Her efforts were ratcheted up soon after becoming a mother, devoting more time to her humanitarian efforts and making trips to countries like Cambodia, Syria, Ukraine, Sierra Leone, Yemen, Afghanistan, and many more.

In 1996, she married her Hackers co-star Jonny Lee Miller (a wedding she attended in black rubber pants and a white tee on which she'd written his name in blood), which lasted till 2000. Shortly after, she married her Pushing Tin co-star Billy Bob Thornton, which was a media frenzy for its three-year run, particularly when they were spotted wearing each other's blood in vials around their necks.</p><p id=eRoL9HfcOS data-wc=66>In 2005, she fell for her Mr & Mrs Smith co-star Brad Pitt. She was blamed as the reason for Pitt's divorce from Jennifer Aniston later that year, a fact all parties involved have denied.

However, their union was not to last, and their contentious divorce was finalized in 2019.</p><p id=ePlcPs1TBi data-wc=100>Jolie adopted Maddox (born August 2001) from Cambodia when she was with Thornton, although became a single parent when they split up months later. In 2005, she adopted Zahara (born January 2005) from an orphanage in Ethiopia, and they were both adopted by Pitt once he and Jolie began a relationship. They welcomed their first biological child, Shiloh, in May 2006 in Namibia, and then adopted Pax (born November 2003) in 2007 from an orphanage in Vietnam. She and Pitt welcomed their twins Knox and Vivienne in July 2008.
