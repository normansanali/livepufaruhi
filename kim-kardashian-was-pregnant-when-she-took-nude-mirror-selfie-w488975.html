I thought, ‘You know what this is my one last shot of a good photo before my body is done,’ so I took a pic.”</p><p>The picture — which showed Kardashian’s naked body covered only by black bars — caused a frenzy on the internet, resulting in Kardashian receiving backlash from stars such as<b> Chloe Grace Moretz</b> and <b>Bette Midler.</b>&nbsp;</p><p>“[I] truly was baffled when people still cared,” Kardashian added. “They have seen me naked 500 times.”</p><p>The reality star was on the talk show to promote her upcoming Kontour Kits, which drop on Wednesday, June 21. The Crème Contour and Highlight Kits — which cost $48 each — will be available starting at 12 p.m. ET.</p><p>“I’m so excited about it,” she shared of the makeup. “I’ve worked so hard in the factories getting the formulas and the packaging. I’m the boss now.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The Selfish author previously explained that her line won’t overshadow sister<b> Kylie Jenner</b>’s booming makeup line.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“A lot of my stuff is going to be for skin.… I’m] trying to mirror skin care with makeup,” Kardashian told WWD. “It’s going to be a different vibe; it’s not going to be a full color cosmetics [range] with shadows and all of that to start. I will probably do some kits here and there of specific [makeup] looks I’ve done and keep it within the looks.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoZ1iuKK%2Bw5qqoaGRo3q4rdJmp6udl6Our8CMsJ%2Bepl2otaZ506impGWeqrGmecyiqaunomLAprjFopxmr2RthXqDlGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
