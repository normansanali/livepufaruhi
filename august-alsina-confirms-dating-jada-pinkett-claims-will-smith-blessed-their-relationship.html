When certain things are questionable that I know is not me, or that I know that, what I haven’t done — contrary to what some people may believe — I’m not a troublemaker.</p><p>“I don’t like drama. Drama actually makes me nauseous. I also don’t think that it’s ever important for people to know what I do, who I sleep with, who I date, right? But, in this instance, it’s very different, ’cause as I said there is so many people that are side-eyeing me, looking at me questionable about it.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>READ ALSO; The Way Regina Daniels Newborn Baby Is Sucking Her B00bs During Breastfeeding In New Video Speaks Volumes</a></strong></p><p>“It’s because people don’t necessarily know the truth, but I never have done anything wrong. I actually sat down with Will and had a conversation.</p><p>“Due to the transformation from their marriage to a life partnership that they spoken on several times, and not involving romanticism, he gave me his blessing.</p><p>“I totally gave myself to that relationship for years of my life. I truly and really, really deeply loved, and have a ton of love for her. I devoted myself to it, I gave my full self to it.</p><p>“So much so to the point that I can die right now and be OK with knowing that I truly gave myself to somebody. I really loved the person that I experienced that [with] and know what [that feels] like — if some people never get that in this lifetime.</p><p>“Because I love these people. I really, genuinely do. I have never been in love in that kind of a way. So much so that being intertwined in that way — walking away from it butchered me.</p><p>“I’m shakin’ right now because it almost killed me. Not almost. It. Broke. Me. Down.”</p><p>Source;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>GhGossip.com</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpqsoK2jqXqiuNKipZplk6S7p7XRpqpmnJGptq%2BzjKOYnZldpbavt8Stq2abnJa2rr%2BMsKClpF2ouqrAx2aZpZ2jqLKledOhnKKqXaeyra3Toqanq5ievXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
