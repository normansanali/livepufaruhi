In 1946, he helped start Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo KK (the Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation) with Ibuka.&nbsp; They had $375 and space in an abandoned department store, shelled by bombs in the war. The company quickly built Japan's first tape recorder, but it was big and bulky -- not a product destined to propel the company into the limelight.&nbsp; Then, in the 1950s, Ibuka and Morita got a license from Bell Labs to build transistors.&nbsp; The Japanese were still hard hit by the war, and couldn't really afford expensive electronics, so Ibuka set his sights on the American market with a brand new idea -- a small, transistorized radio that could fit in your pocket.&nbsp; As it was, a US company <a href=#>built such a radio</a> first, but more as a gimmick than an actual product.&nbsp; When Sony, as Morita's company was soon renamed, came out with their radio, it quickly took over the market.&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Morita's business strength was in his ability to study both Western and Eastern cultures and combine the best parts of each.&nbsp; With this expertise, he was often consulted about US-Japanese trade issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1993, he collapsed on a tennis court with a brain hemorrhage, and consequently completely removed himself from working at Sony.&nbsp; He died in Tokyo of pneumonia in October, 1999, at the age of 78.</p><p align=center><span>Copyright 1999, ScienCentral, Inc, and The American Institute of Physics.</span> <span>No portion of this web site may be reproduced without written permission.
