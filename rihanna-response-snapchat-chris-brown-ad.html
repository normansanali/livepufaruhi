In a lengthy statement on her Instagram story this morning, the singer berated the social media platform for its insensitivity towards domestic violence victims.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her message reads:</p>"Now SNAPCHAT I know you already know you ain't my fav app out there! But I'm just trying to figure out what the point was with this mess! I'd love to call it ignorance, but I know you ain't that dumb! You spent money to animate something that would intentionally bring shame to DV [domestic violence] victims and made a joke of it!!! This isn't about my personal feelings, cause I don't have much of them...but all the women, children and men that have been victims of DV in the past and especially the ones who haven't made it out yet....you let us down! Shame on you. Throw the whole app-ology away."<img alt="Text, Red, Black, Font, " title="Text, Red, Black, Font, " width=750 height=1334 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/unknown-1521131039.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Instagram</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The distasteful ad asked users if they would rather “Slap Rihanna” or “Punch Chris Brown,” alluding to the the time Brown assaulted the “Wild Thoughts” singer in 2009. (He was sentenced to serve five yeas probation, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/08/25/chris.brown.sentencing/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=CNN class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">CNN</a> reported at the time.) It's unclear what the ad was for, exactly.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Users promptly noticed the insensitive ad and spoke out on Twitter.
