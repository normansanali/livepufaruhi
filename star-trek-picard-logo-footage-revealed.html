Not only did the crowdfunded&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Space Nine</a>&nbsp;documentary see a theatrical release (for a single night, mind you), but a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">long-standing question regarding Garak’s sexuality was finally laid to rest</a>. Patrick Stewart fans, meanwhile, will be glad to hear that a new series <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">focusing on Jean-Luc Picard has officially entered production</a>, and earlier today at the company’s All Access Upfronts presentation, CBS finally lifted the curtain on this new entry in the franchise.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>As reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ComicBook.com</a>, those in attendance were treated to a first look at the show’s title, logo and even some never-before-seen footage. Up until now, the series has remained untitled, but during the presentation, CBS executives referred to it as <strong>Star Trek: Picard</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true>A logo appeared on screen as well, featuring the title spelled out in gold letters, with the Starfleet insignia taking the place of the letter “A” in Picard. It’s not entirely clear whether the name and logo are tentative or permanent, but we’re big fans of how simple and to-the-point they are.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/D6om4fWW0AE_xa2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-15-at-5.jpg><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>That’s not the only thing which was shown off, though. Audience members also got a brief glimpse at some new footage, and Buzzfeed News reporter Kate Aurthur was able to post a pic on Twitter. CBS hasn’t shed much light on the plot, though, as ComicBook.com notes, executive producer Alex Kurtzman explained it’ll explore Picard as a character, as it delves into his personality.</p><p>“The mandate was to make it a more psychological show, a character study about this man in his emeritus years,” said Kurtzman. “There are so few shows that allow a significantly older protagonist to be the driver.”</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=732 data-injectable=true>From what we understand, the series is set to take place 18 years after the events of Star Trek: Nemesis,&nbsp;with Picard being deeply affected by the destruction of Romulus (as shown in J.J. Abrams’&nbsp;Star Trek&nbsp;reboot). Details may be scarce, but thankfully, fans won’t have to wait long to catch the captain in action again.</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=236 data-injectable=false><strong>Star Trek: Picard&nbsp;</strong>is set to premiere later this year, with its first season consisting of 10 episodes. In North America, the show will stream exclusively on CBS All Access, while global streaming rights have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">snatched up by Amazon</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0wMCrZK2qlaB6sbXCmqmdZZyktLB5xaimrZmXmnqzsdWemKWdlGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
