One day after news of her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>alleged split</a> from her husband,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dalton Gomez</strong></a>, 27, broke, the “Thank U, Next” hitmaker was spotted on a shopping trip with her&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Wicked&nbsp;</a>co-star&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cynthia Erivo</strong></a>, 36 (see <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PHOTOS HERE</a>). While enjoying the gals’ day, Ari looked casual, yet chic, in an oversized <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pink cardigan</a>, light-colored jeans, and white high heel boots. The 30-year-old completed her ensemble with pearl hoop earrings,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> oversized sunglasses</a>, and a white <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Wimbledon</a> cap. Ariana was also notably sans her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wedding ring</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ariana-grande-and-cynthia-erivo-in-first-photos-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Meanwhile, her 36-year-old pal opted for a similarly casual, yet trendy, ensemble. Cynthia looked effortlessly stylish in a leopard-print cardigan, white crop top, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>baggy jeans</a>. The London native made sure to add the cutest accessories, including teal hoop earrings, a tan <strong>Louis Vuitton</strong> purse, a brown baseball cap, and blue athletic sneakers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>While leaving a shop on Bond Street, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Grammy winner</a> appeared to be in good spirits and was even pictured smiling. Ari carried an iced beverage in-hand, as she engaged in a light conversation with Cynthia. The two actresses left a store that appeared to sell fine leather purses, which Ariana was noticeably not missing, as she carried her luxurious Courrèges Reedition Zipped Camera Bag on her arm.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>As previously mentioned, her outing in London comes just one day after&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ&nbsp;</a>reported that Ariana and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her husband</a> are heading toward getting divorced. The outlet reported that the duo has been separated since January and although they allegedly tried to mend their troubles earlier this year, they “failed” at their attempts. Ariana notably moved to the U.K. in Dec. 2022 to work on the two-part <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Wicked&nbsp;films</a>, but the outlet claimed that their marital issues began prior to her move.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Although news of their alleged split broke on Jul. 17, Ari sparked breakup rumors after she was spotted at Wimbledon <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>without her wedding ring</a> on Jul. 16. The songstress also took to Instagram on Monday and shared a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>carousel of photos</a> from her time at the tennis match. She did not appear to be wearing the ring in those photos either. Ariana and the real estate agent got married in May 2021.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Most recently, the latest report from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ&nbsp;</a>claimed that Dalton has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>been “dating”</a> for the “last few months” and that, Ari had allegedly given him the green light to do so. The two reportedly were “shocked” that no one knew of their split until Monday, as they have been allegedly separated for months. In the meantime, blonde beauty is taking a break from work as the production for the&nbsp;<strong>Jon M. Chu</strong>-directed movies are on pause amid the ongoing <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>SAG-AFTRA strike</a>, per&nbsp;The Daily Mail.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BxZpqqmZa7onnGq5innJViwKm7z6mgp59dobyvsM6nZJ%2BhoqjBbrzHqKuoq12ova2102g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
