"Tom isn't taking things well," a source told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>. "He wants to reconcile and was still holding out hope that they could work things out." Brady was reportedly "hurt" and felt "abandoned." And, now that the star quarterback announced he's retiring for good, fans were quick to <a href=#>joke</a> about how a reconciliation between the two may happen.</p><p dir=ltr>On the February 1 episode of <a href=#>"The View,"</a>&nbsp;Whoopi Goldberg had a strong opinion on whether or not a reconciliation between Brady and Bündchen is possible. "Ya'll, it went as far as it could go and it's done," the host stated. She then mentioned that she was happy that they still appear to have respect for each other and their shared kids. "And congratulations Gisele for going off and doing whatever you're doing ... and to you Tom going and having a good time," she added.</p><p>Since the divorce, Bündchen has focused on her modeling career. She recently did a <a href=#>photoshoot</a> with Louis Vuitton. <a href=#>Brady plans</a> to get into sports broadcasting. He's also getting ready to promote the release of "80 for Brady," and has said that he may act a little more in the future, per <a href=#>Variety</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamloa4B6fI6wn6inoJ56qLvLnZmeqpdiwbDAwKWjsmWUmrOmusOsZK2nnWKvs63DsmSappRitKq%2FxKWcZpqlo7GktMSnqmaroKG2tXnIp2SwmZuaerCyjKGgrGWimsGqvsSmnKesXaOyuL%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
