With multiple places to play there is little stopping players from at least giving the game a chance.</p><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>With all multiplayer games, you’re going to want to play alongside your friends and with the variety of consoles available you may be wondering, can you play alongside others on different platforms?</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Does FFXIV have Cross-Platform play?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Riding-Chocobos-in-Final-Fantasy-XIV-670x335.jpg><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>Yes! You can play <strong>Final Fantasy XIV</strong> alongside your friends no matter what console that they reside on and you can also play your characters and keep progress from one device to another. There are a few things worth noting though.</p><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>Firstly, if you plan on playing between the two consoles you will need to purchase the expansions for both platforms. You can’t just own them on a single platform and continue with them on the other. This is costly so it could deter players from using this feature.</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>You aren’t going to retain your client information from either PC or PlayStation when logging in to the other. This is stuff like spell bindings, settings preferences, UI set up, and other small quality of life changes you may have made while playing.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=196 data-injectable=false>The good news though, going between devices won’t impact any of the stuff that matters including your characters, items, story progress, and the rest of the things that make your account unique.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=false>Playing between consoles will only be an issue if the players reside on different data servers, though this will still be an issue if you were both on the same platform making it less of a cross-play issue and more something to remember.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZom6ido2Kzp8TIr2ShmaaaeqS%2BzqyqZqiclsGnu9GmZKmkka58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
