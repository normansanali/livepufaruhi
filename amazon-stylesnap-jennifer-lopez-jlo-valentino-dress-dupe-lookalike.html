That is, until we look it up and realize it’s $5,000 dollars or more. So we sigh and we let it go. We’re not against making an investment in our clothing, but sometimes there is just no justification.</p><p>This is exactly what happened when we spotted <strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong> heading out to eat with fiancé <strong>Alex Rodriguez</strong> and family just the other day. She was wearing such a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pretty white dress</a> with multicolor floral embroidery making its way down the chest and sleeves. We were in love! But when we looked it up and realized it was Valentino? Our hearts sank. $5,400 is a bit much for Us. But then we remembered <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon StyleSnap</a>!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Fill your wardrobe with amazing pieces using <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon StyleSnap</a> today!</strong></p><p>What is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon StyleSnap</a>? How does it work? We’re here to answer all of your questions, using J. Lo’s dress as an example. The service was created for fashion influencers to make their looks more accessible to followers, but we can also use it to find celeb-worn pieces or super similar styles. All it takes to get started is a screenshot!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p>First, simply take a screenshot of a photo featuring the piece you’re looking for, open up the Amazon app on your phone and click the camera icon (shown above) next to the search bar. You’ll then see an “Upload a Photo” button (shown below), so get it uploading that screenshot! Once the photo is uploaded, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">StyleSnap</a> will do a quick digital search (5 to 10 seconds) of the image to find and identify products. You will see dots appear on the image as this is being done.</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Fill your wardrobe with amazing pieces using <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon StyleSnap</a> today!</strong></p><p>And then, voila! Scroll down to see your recommendations. You might find the exact piece you were looking for, but you also might find some great alternatives. With J. Lo’s dress, we were definitely looking for more of a look-alike style, and we found multiple affordable options. Amazon has so many clothing brands, you’re pretty much bound to find something you’ll love!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p>Don’t forget that once your results pop up, you can filter as you normally would to narrow things down. Filter by gender, price and if it’s on Amazon Prime, and then sort your prices from low to high, or sort based on customer reviews or newest arrivals. Amazon makes it so easy to find what you’re looking for. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">This tool</a> is seriously just the thing to transform your closet, so try it out today and see what awesome pieces you find!</p><p><strong>Fill your wardrobe with amazing pieces using <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon StyleSnap</a> today!</strong></p><p><b><i>Check out more of our <a href=# rel>picks and deals</a></i></b><b><i>!</i></b></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6OyuL%2BOmqSasp%2BjerTA2KWcrKaRpXqrsc2noJ%2BdomK5sLzEs2SjpJ9iw6K4xKeroqafYrGzsdKsZJ2toJp6rbvOpJiloZuafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
