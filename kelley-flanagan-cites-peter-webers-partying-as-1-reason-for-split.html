There was a while where I was trying to convince myself that that’s what I liked and I was like, ‘Alright, Kelley, let’s be honest with yourself. Does that add up for you?’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kelley-Flanagan-Gives-More-Insight-Into-Non-Negotiables-Peter-Weber-Split.jpg><p>Weber, 29, announced his split from Flanagan, who he eliminated ahead of the hometown dates on season 24 of The Bachelor,<a href=#> on New Year’s Eve after eight months of dating.</a></p><p>“I asked him not to do it on New Year’s and I was like, ‘Can you just give me a couple days to tell people?’ I think there was something he wanted to do [to end] 2020,” she said. “We talked to ABC, you have to do all that stuff, and ABC was like, ‘Guys, try to drown it out with the premiere. Do it the day before, drown it out people will be excited about other things.’ … He had to do it in 2020.”</p><p>Flanagan previously told <a href=#><strong>Kaitlyn Bristowe</strong> </a>in March that there were “a lot of non-negotiables” in their relationship, <a href=#>revealing on the “Off the Vine” podcast that they briefly got back together</a> before calling it quits for good in February.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I came [to New York City] for Valentine’s Day, we had a great Valentine’s Day together,” she told <a href=#><strong>Maria Ciuffo </strong></a>and<a href=#><strong> Francesca Mariano</strong></a> on Friday. “And then, again, there were just like little things. … It ended really badly. I essentially went off on him. I ended up leaving New York and going to one of my girlfriend’s houses and hanging out with her. He texted me, I didn’t respond and then found some news out that I wasn’t happy about. We still had each other on Find My Friends. … I went off and essentially said, like, ’Get the hell out of my life.’<a href=#> It ended really badly</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kelley-Flanagan-Gives-More-Insight-Into-Non-Negotiables-Peter-Weber-Split-2.jpg><p>While Weber previously told <a href=#>Us Weekly on the “Here for the Right Reasons” podcast</a> that he would <a href=#>welcome seeing Flanagan after she moves to New York City,</a> Flanagan said on Friday that she would “just run” if she saw him.</p><p>“He messaged me the other day and I’m just not responsive,” she said. “There’s a lot of things that you hear, this world is very small. I even get stopped by girls in Nashville and they’re like, ‘My friend hooked up with Peter last week!’ … I’ve had that [happen] a couple of times.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknZyhsrp5xaWYp5mXlrtur8itnKxloJrBpr6MsJybnaKoerGt0a2woqaXYq60eZBmqZ6Zo6S7brLOq2SsqJyewXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
