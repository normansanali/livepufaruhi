Given that, what could the title be for the third entry in the series, which will likely arrive in a few years’ time?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Well, this awesome fan art pitches one idea for the threequel. Prolific digital artist BossLogic was inspired by the&nbsp;Far From Home&nbsp;title to imagine a third&nbsp;film called&nbsp;Spider-Man: Homies.&nbsp;And as you can tell from the artwork below, the premise of this hypothetical project is that Peter Parker would team up with his fellow Spider-Man, Miles Morales.</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>Just like the style of real teaser posters, BossLogic’s work takes a subtle approach to the characters coming together. As one leg of Parker in costume’s shown, so is Miles’ right leg. You can catch a glimpse of his black costume beneath his shorts and sneakers, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DgdyHt8V4AUR-qD.jpg><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>Honestly, this is a great concept and we really hope it’s what Marvel’s planning for&nbsp;Homecoming 3. Miles was alluded to in the first movie, after all, with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Feige confirming that he exists</a> out there in the MCU somewhere and saying it’s possible they’ll include the character at a later date. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Holland’s definitely on board</a> with the idea, as well, going on record&nbsp;to reveal that he’d like to fight alongside Morales one day.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>It doesn’t look like he’ll be introduced in&nbsp;Far From Home, either, so the threequel would be the perfect place to include him. It would also fit Peter’s character arc. Presumably by that point in his life, he’d be mature and experienced enough to play the Iron Man role and act as a mentor to Miles.</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=694 data-injectable=false>Luckily, we don’t have to wait that long to see Miles Morales and Peter Parker team up on the big screen. Sony’s animated movie&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</a>&nbsp;will see the Ultimate <strong>Spider-Man</strong>‘s cinematic debut on December 14th. And though it’s not as good as having them come together in the MCU, we’re certainly looking forward to it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqqmhlJq%2FbrnAp2SfmZ5irrPAjKagpZ2jYrqwvsClnKxlnZjCbrDEm6ytZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
