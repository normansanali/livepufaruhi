But it’s very new and very, you know, it’s dating, essentially. No one’s calling us a relationship yet. … How funny would it be if I actually found the love of my life during a pandemic? I’m looking for that soulmate stuff.”</p><p>The couple went Instagram official in January 2021 with Burgess posting <a href=#>a steamy photo of them kissing on a balcony</a>. One year later, Burgess and Green announced that they were expecting their first child together. Their son, Zane, arrived in June 2022.</p><p>“We couldn’t be happier, and everybody’s extremely healthy right now, which is a blessing,” Green exclusively told Us three months later. “I always say that the easiest part is to become a mother or a father. Almost anybody can have a baby, but to be a parent — that’s the work. Getting up in the morning, making breakfast, making lunch for school, bedtime rituals and bathtime … that’s when the real work comes in. “[Sharna’s] amazing with that. She’s been so hands-on with him. ”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Green&nbsp;was previously married to <a href=#><strong>Megan Fox</strong></a>.
