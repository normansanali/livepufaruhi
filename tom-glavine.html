Even at the end of his career, he was an effective starting pitcher in the National League due to his excellent control and deception, switching speeds, and locating pitches off the outside corner of the strike zone. His most common approach was to begin by locating his circle changeup off the outside corner, then follow with alternating fastballs and changeups to confuse the hitter. While batters frequently made contact with his pitches, the substantial movement he placed on them made drives very soft, resulting in easily fielded ground balls and fly outs. Glavine’s consistency was also highlighted by his durability; since his first full year in 1988, he started at least 25 games every year and was never placed on the disabled list until his final season—at age 42. In addition to his excellent changeup and well-controlled fastball, Glavine had a plus-curve ball, a slider, and a tailing two-seam fastball. Despite being a left-handed pitcher, Glavine was often more effective against right-handed batters. Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully noted that this attribute was likely due to Glavine pitching from the extreme right edge of the pitching rubber.</p><h2>Tom Glavine Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Tom Glavine is one of the <strong>richest Baseball Player</strong> from United States.
