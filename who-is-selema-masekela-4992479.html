I am tempted to run into the shadows and hide, only to return to the light when I have regained my strength enough for me to say, ‘Whatever, my life is better this way.’ But I am reminded that the magnitude of the pain I am feeling is equal to the measure of my capacity for love.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>At the end of her full statement, Lupita added “#breakup” and concluded, “I share this to keep it [real] and hoping that the knowledge of my experience might be useful to someone else out there experiencing the grip of heartbreak who is poised to try and escape from the pain and miss out on the wisdom that comes from it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>So who exactly is Selema?
