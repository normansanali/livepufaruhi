Krauthammer is estimated by authoritative sources to have a net worth of over $10 million,&nbsp; most of this wealth earned working as a syndicated columnist as well as a political commentator.</p><h3>Charles Krauthammer Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>Charles Krauthammer was born in the city of New York; his father was from Ukraine and his mother Belgian, both Orthodox Jews, so he and his brother received a rigorous Jewish education at a Hebrew school. The family moved to Montreal, Canada, where Krauthammer did all his schooling, then enrolled at McGill University, in Montreal, from where he graduated with 1st Class Honors in 1970, majoring in political science and economics. In 1971, he became a political commonwealth scholar at Balliol College Oxford, in the UK, before eventually returning to the US where he attended Harvard School for a Medical Course. During the first year of medical school, he suffered a diving board accident that left most parts of his body paralyzed, since when he has been confined to a wheelchair.</p><p>The unfortunate events did not deter Krauthammer from achieving his dreams. He continued with his studies after 14 months of hospitalization, graduating in 1975. The same year, he became a resident in psychiatry working for Massachusetts general Hospital until 1978, and then moved to work in psychiatric research in Washington, DC. In 1981, he started writing for The New Republican on political issues, also serving as a vice-president and a speech writer in the company, and he was offered the position as an editor too. In 1983 began writing essays for Time magazine; one of the essays, ‘Reagan Doctrine,’ gave him the exposure he wanted, bringing him national acclaim. His net worth was beginning to climb significantly.</p><p>Krauthammer was certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology in 1984, and the same year his essay, ‘The New Republic’ won an award for essays and criticism. In 1987, he was awarded the ‘Pulitzer Prize.’ for commentary virtue of his contributions to The Washington Post, perhaps his greatest achievement. He was offered a position as panelist for Inside Washington, to contribute a weekly political roundabout, and he remained with the show from 1990 until December 2013 when it ceased production. Since then he has been a commentator and political analyst for Fox News. His net worth has grown accordingly.</p><p>He was also selected by the Financial Times as America’s most influential commentator, which stated that he had played an important role in influencing foreign policy in the US for over two decades through his contribution in the development of ‘The Reagan Doctrine,’ released in 1985. He also published ‘The Unipolar Moment,’ an essay that explained the role of the US as a superpower.</p><p>In 2002, he was appointed to the Presidential Council on Bioethics, where he opposed euthanasia, human cloning and human experimentation. In 2004, Krauthammer delivered a speech dubbed ‘Democratic Realism’ after winning the Irving Kristol Award, setting out a framework that he believed would tackle the post-9-11 world. His main agenda was promoting democracy in all regions of the Middle East. In 2009, he was invited to the White House by the president, <a href=#>Barack Obama</a>, to sign an executive order, but declined because of his conservative views, and so opposition to some of the president’s policies. Regardless, in a press conference in 2010, former US president <a href=#>Bill Clinton</a> called him a brilliant man.</p><p>Krauthammer published his book ‘Things That Matter: Three Decades of Passion, Pastimes and Politics,’ in 2013 which remained as one of the best selling books on The New York Times list for 22 weeks, 10 of which were at number one.
