And sometimes the terms that need clarifying go way beyond specific trends. Like when it comes to clothing offerings, what's the difference between plus-size and size-inclusive?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the past few years, the fashion industry has slowly made some progress in creating clothing for every body type, but there's still more work to be done — and our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>2020 runway report</a> is proof.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To find out more about how sizing in fashion has evolved (and continues to evolve), keep reading for our explainer on the difference between plus-size and size-inclusive clothing.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-plus-size-clothing></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Plus-Size Clothing?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Initially, "plus-size" was a term that used to represent clothing made above a size 12, which is the highest size that many brands still continue to offer. However, that term unfairly made the people buying those clothes feel othered — it insinuated people in that range aren't normal sized, they are extra. (Interestingly, the average height, weight, and waist circumference for adult women aged 20 and over is roughly a size 18 to 20, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>according to the CDC</a>.) This was especially brutal in cases where clothes are placed in a completely different section of a store.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-size-inclusive-clothing></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Size-Inclusive Clothing?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In response, there has been a pivot toward using "size-inclusive" to refer to clothing offerings instead. Plus-size, on the other hand, has become something of a way for people to identify, if they so choose, and come together as a fashion and body-positive community. (Our seasonal <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>plus-size street style gallery</a> is an example of some of these people, showing their best looks on the streets of NYC every Fashion Week.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Christian Siriano Draws Celebs' Dream Dresses</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the most part, size-inclusive means that on top of having sizes previously referred to as "straight sizes," a.k.a. 0 to 12, a brand offers larger sizes of the same items, too. In an ideal world, all sizes are simply included in the same drop-down menu or on the same rack — you won't have to seek them out, and it feels, quite simply, inclusive.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-future-of-sizing></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Future of Sizing</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The part where things get tricky, though, is when we talk about how high sizing will go. A brand may claim to offer plus-size and size-inclusive options, or say it's "expanding" its sizes, but then clothes will only go up to a size 22 or 2x. What about people who are a size 24? What if you're above a 2x? It costs money to make a larger range, and we understand that, but people continue to be left out. And, considering brands like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Universal Standard</a> offer the same exact clothing styles up to a size 40, we're confused why more lines can't follow suit.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-final-thoughts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Final Thoughts</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps in a few years, the industry will have evolved even more, and we won't need terms like plus-size or size-inclusive to refer to clothing because all brands will offer every size. For now, however, we hope we've at least cleared up the vocabulary.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3yltcWfnKudnpiybq7Era6enZ5iwKrGxGagp5ucqsCqwsRmraxloKHCtHnSorGe</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
