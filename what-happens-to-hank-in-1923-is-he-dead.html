However, one of the Priests survives. Hank lets down his gun to carry Teonna, who is injured during the conflict. As a result, the Priests use the gun to shoot Hank. As a result, Hank dies while trying to protect Teonna. Hank’s character concludes with his death as he keeps his word to Teonna until his last breath. Moreover, he also paves the way for Teonna to reunite with her father before his death. Nonetheless, Hank’s death is untimely and comes as a major surprise for the viewers. With his character’s death, it is safe to say that actor Michael Greyeyes’ time on the show has ended.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwqrrEppihp5yesG%2BvzqZmsKCRqXqprc%2BpnKerXam8brTAp6JmoZ5ifnp%2BkmagrGWYmnqlscCdZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
