The <a href=#>“House That Built Me” singer</a> is the fourth highest-nominated artist of all time, behind <strong>George Strait</strong>, <strong>Alan Jackson</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Brad Paisley</strong></a>.</p><p>Ahead of the show, Lambert won Music Video of the Year for “Bluebird.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Miranda-Lambert-Settling-Down-CMAs-2020.jpg><p>Country music’s biggest night was the first awards show of the year to be done with a real audience and to have celebrities in attendance amid the coronavirus pandemic. All others have been done virtually or without fans.</p><p>Lambert, who had 13 CMA award wins heading into the night, first appeared on the iconic awards show stage 15 years ago with her 2005 performance of “Kerosene.”</p><p>“I was terrified to get on that stage. It was the year it was at Madison Square Garden. Not only was it my first time in New York City, but it was the CMAs,” the Texas native said in <a href=#>a CMAs video posted last month</a>, reflecting on the big moment. “I had a million things going through my mind. Now, I definitely know the feel of butterflies was because I cared so much. I felt like a lot was riding on that performance. It was sort of my first time to say, ‘Hey, here’s who I am as an artist.’”</p><p>Lambert’s Wednesday performance came weeks after the release of <a href=#>her music video</a> for “Settling Down,” in which her husband, <a href=#><strong>Brendan McLoughlin</strong></a>, made a cameo — and his music video debut.</p><p>“I think we understand why we had him in my video,” the songstress <a href=#>told her fans during a live Q&A on YouTube</a> in October, after the clip for her new song was released. “Because he’s really pretty and I needed a video babe and he was there, so I mean, it just worked out.”</p><p>The Grammy winner added: “My favorite part of filming was watching my husband sort of come to life on camera. It was his video debut and he’s so sweet and humble about it, but he really killed it, so that was fun to watch.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lambert and McLoughlin, 30, <a href=#>tied the knot in January 2019</a>. The pair met two months prior <a href=#>on the set of <i>Good Morning America</i></a> where the former NYPD officer was working security.</p><p>The country singer was married to <a href=#><strong>Blake Shelton</strong></a> from 2011 to 2015. He <a href=#>announced his engagement</a> to <a href=#><strong>Gwen Stefani</strong></a> late last month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqmmV2WxKK%2Bw6xka2hiZXqutdGapZ2ZXaGurq7Eq6tmq5mjtLR50p6rraSZo7RusM6wpWakmauycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
