He made his return to the ring in 2021 and started wrestling more frequently with ROH/AEW in 2022. Shibata became a featured member of the ROH roster and won the ROH Pure Championship, but he has not wrestled for NJPW since January 2022.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tokyo Sports</a>, Shibata noted that if there was no place for him in NJPW, then there was no reason for him to be there. (H/t Jeremy Lambert of <a href=#>Fightful </a>for the translation)</p><p>“I can’t work as an affiliated fighter,” Shibata said. “I guess that (New Japan’s decision) is not wrong. But if there is no place for me, then there is no reason for me to be here. I’ve regained a lot of my senses after competing in AEW, and I feel like I want to finish my career here.”</p><p>Shibata also commented on his health, saying, “I’ve been checked by a doctor, and I’ve given him a medical certificate. If I don’t clear it, I can’t compete.”</p><p>Shibata was reportedly forced to take some time away from AEW/ROH, as he had to return to Japan. More information is available <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p>In December, AEW <a href=#>officially announced</a> that Shibata signed with the company. It is not known when he will return to AEW programming.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsbGpxZ2K4osDSrrCoqpliwKm1wZqrmmWjlsa0eceeZLCZnqnAbsDOZp2ippmotW60yKxknJmimrKzedaiq6FlkZrE</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
