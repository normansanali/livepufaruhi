Her Bio, Age, Job, Parents</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><span style=font-weight:400>Losing someone special is heartbreaking, and even more when it’s on a special day. </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>X Factor</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> performer, Tom Mann’s fiancee Dani Hampson suddenly died on the morning of their wedding, leaving the singer in an “ocean” of tears and grief-stricken.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, who was she? Get to know all about Tom’s late fiancee as this Dani Hampson Bio proceeds.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Meet Dani Hampson, Tom Mann Fiancee</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Dani Hampson and Tom Mann were together ever since 2009. “You took me under your wing & have had my back ever since,” Tom recalled his late fiancee.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Fast forward to May 2019, the lovebirds then bought their first home they’d like to call “our diamond in the rough and our safe place.” Also, in December that very year, the singer popped the question to the love of his life with a beautiful diamond ring at the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Piano Bar and Restaurant</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in Piano Kensington.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“Christmas came early. Introducing my future husband,” Dani shared her happiness at the time v.i.a her IG.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, with everything in place, Dani and Tom then planned to get married in 2020. But sadly, COVID hit the world and everything went on lockdown.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Likewise, their plans to get married in 2021 also got postponed due to their professional lives. However, amidst disappointments, on October 18, 2021, the duo shared the good news that their baby Bowie Andrew Mann — their “highlight, proudest moment & biggest achievement” — stepped into his world.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“We are saturated with a love I didn’t know existed & one I will never be able to put into words. Bowie Andrew Mann Born 18.10.2021. You have changed our lives forever,” Dani shared over an IG post feating their little one at the time.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, starting the year 2022, Dani recalled, “2021 started much like 2020 – expecting to become husband & wife – only we ended up as mum & dad instead.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But little did the star performer know that 2022 was going to be the darkest year of his life. On June 18, 2022, the day he was supposed to officially become Dani’s husband, she left this world.</span></p><h3><b>Dani Hampson Cause Of Death</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>It was Tom Mann who first revealed the news about his fiancee’s death v.i.a an IG post, but he didn’t mention her cause of death. However, as per “celebseek.com,” Dani Hampson had just returned from a vacation in Sardinia with Tom and she had no known medical issues at the time. So, her death’s certainly a mystery.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“I can’t believe I am writing these words but my darling Dani – my best friend, my everything and more, the love of my life – passed away in the early hours of Saturday morning, 18th June,”&nbsp; Tom wrote over his IG.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He then followed the paragraph with long words of love grieving and recalling all their days in the sun. To summarize, Tom might not have had the chance to marry his fiancee, but she was already his entire world. He promised to wear the ring he was supposed to as a sign of his unconditional love.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Tom added that though he was lost without, he will be strong for the sake of their little one. “I will not be a mark on the parent that you had already become but I promise I will do my everything to raise Bowie just the way we always wanted,” he promised.</span></p><h3><b>Dani Hampson Age At The Time Of Her Death</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Dani Hampson was 34 years of age at the time of her death.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She was 6 years older than her fiance Tom.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Talking about their age gap, Dani once joked, “The thing about our age gap is he’s like a fine wine & I’m aging at the speed of unrefrigerated milk.”</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact: </b><span style=font-weight:400>Tom sang Elton John’s “Rocket Man” almost every day of Dani’s 3rd trimester. The son was also in Dani’s labor playlist and was number 1 the day Bowie was born.</span></p><h3><b>What Do We Know About Dani Hampson Parents?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Dani Hampson was born to parents, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Martin</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Janette</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> Hampson.
