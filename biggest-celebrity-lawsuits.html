The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lifestyles of the rich and famous</a> can sometimes get sadly complicated, and the cost of living for that high-profile lifestyle can be a steep one — especially when it leads to lawsuits. A lot of your favorite celebrities have seen the inside of a courtroom, from Sussex royals Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to <a href=# rel=noopener>recently separated Kelly Clarkson</a> and beyond. And while they’re better equipped financially to arm themselves for legal battles than the average person, we’re saddened by how often what they’re fighting to legally protect is their basic privacy, right to decent treatment, or protection from someone trying to take away their earnings.</p><a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jennifer-aniston-2.jpg alt="Jennifer Aniston & Nancy Dow" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">18 Celebrity Family Feuds We Can't Believe Played Out in Public</span></a><p>That being said, the celebrity lawsuits that have stood the test of time are those that made their mark on Hollywood history, either shedding light on longstanding issues of sexual harassment and assault, like <a href=# rel=noopener>Rose McGowan’s lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein</a> or Kesha’s lawsuit against Dr. Luke, or setting new standards about what’s accepted practice for everyone from paparazzi to on-set drivers.

Among the <a href=#>accusations made by the royal</a> are that the publisher, from years of 1991 to 2011, acquired information in unlawful ways such as phone-hacking and wire-tapping.</p><p>“I hope that the court’s finding will serve as a warning to all media organizations who have employed these practices and then similarly lied about it,” Harry’s lawyer David Sherbourne said in a statement outside the courthouse following the decision. “My commitment to seeing this case through is based on my belief in our need and collective right to a free and honest press. The mission continues.”</p><p>The newspapers were ordered to pay the Duke of Sussex $180,000 for using unlawful information gathering in 15 of the 33 newspaper articles examined at trial, per <a href=# rel=nofollow>Associated Press</a>.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.2840447154472><h2>Blac Chyna vs The Kardashians</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1258508360.jpg><p>In 2017, Blac Chyna sued the Kardashian family after the reality show with her ex Rob Kardashian, Rob & Chyna, was canceled following their split. Chyna sued the Kardashians for allegedly interfering with her reality show’s future. At the time of filing, Chyna was seeking $108 million in damages. “Blac Chyna will seek millions in compensatory and punitive damages from Kris [Jenner], Kim [Kardashian], Khloé [Kardashian], and Kylie [Jenner] for defamation, intentional interference with contract, and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,” Chyna’s lawyer told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>Five years later, in May 2022, the Los Angeles jury found the Kardashian clan not liable or guilty, per<a href=# rel=nofollow> Associated Press</a>.

And while the terms of the deal were not disclosed, both parties settled a few months later in September.&nbsp;</p><p>“I am happy to have resolved our differences with Disney,” Johansson told the outlet. “I’m incredibly proud of the work we’ve done together over the years and have greatly enjoyed my creative relationship with the team.

Well, a lot of people do, and many weren’t thrilled when the same came on, specifically grime artiste Sam Chokri and producer Ross O’Donoghue, who accused him of plagiarism.</p><p>Chokri claimed the “Oh I” hook in Sheeran’s track was “strikingly similar” to one of his own sons. Back in 2022, after 11 days, the judge ruled in favor of Sheeran, saying he had “neither deliberately nor subconsciously copied” Chokri’s song.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=10.039184952978><h2>Travis Scott vs Astroworld Victims</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1463028090.jpg><p>After the Astroworld tragedy in 2021 that took nine lives, Travis Scott was hit with lawsuit after lawsuit from those injured, and the family of the deceased.</p><p>Per the <a href=#>Buzzfeed News</a>, a number of those who’ve filed suits cited “negligence” and “encouragement of violence.” Sources close to Scott maintain that the rapper wasn’t aware of the tragedy until “hours” after his performance</p><p>The latest victim, Shanazia Williamson, filed a lawsuit against the rapper in May 2022 claiming her “unborn child” died after she was “crushed” during the crowd surge, <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> reports.&nbsp;</p><p>As of September 2023, there were 1,500 active cases filed against Scott and Live Nation, the concert promoter, per <a href=# rel=nofollow>Associated Press</a>.

Back when they were together, they decided that neither would sell their stakes in the business without consultation, but Jolie sold hers to a Russian liquor giant named Stoli, led by businessman Yuri Shefler.&nbsp;</p><p>In response to Pitt’s suit, Jolie filed a $250 million countersuit, alleging that Pitt was merely being vindictive for how their previous custody battle turned out. Most recently, in Oct. 2023, Pitt’s lawyers <a href=#>requested additional documents from the Russian businessman</a> in an attempt to prove that Jolie and Shefler were secretly planning to shut Pitt out of&nbsp; negotiations all along.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>Alec Baldwin vs Halyna Hutchins’ Family</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1457188377.jpg><p>One of the biggest tragedies in 2021 was the horrific shooting incident on the set of Rust involving Alec Baldwin and cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who passed from the incident after a gunshot wound.

Along with that, he claimed she was abusive towards him, with her countersuing Depp for $100 million since his former attorney Adam Waldman called her allegations a “hoax.”</p><p>After a six-week-long televised trial, the jury ruled in favor of Depp, who was awarded $10.35 million in damages. Heard did win one of the three claims, and was <a href=#>awarded around $2 million in compensatory damages</a>.

Mueller claimed the contact was inadvertent, but Swift testified, saying, “It was a definite grab. A very long grab,” <a href=#>The Guardian</a> reports.&nbsp;</p><p>She countersued Mueller for a symbolic $1 because she wanted the trial to serve as an “example to other women,” <a href=# rel=nofollow>NPR</a> reports. In a championing moment during the trial, Mueller’s lawyer asked Swift how she felt about Mueller losing his job over the encounter to which Swift responded, “I’m not going to allow you or your client to make me feel in any way that this is my fault.” She added, “<a href=#>Here we are years later, and I’m being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life</a> that are the product of his decisions — not mine.” Swift won the suit in August 2017.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.5811170212766><h2>Britney Spears vs. Jamie Spears</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1661130739.jpg><p>The legal battles between pop icon Britney Spears and her father Jamie Spears were more than a decade in the making. Jamie was the dominant member of the team running his daughter’s 13-year conservatorship, which finally ended in November 2021. Since reclaiming her freedom and autonomy, Britney continued to take these legal battles one step further.</p><p>During <a href=#>her heartbreaking testimony</a> amidst her conservatorship hearings, Britney alleged that <a href=#>her father mishandled her finances</a>, profited off her work, and more. More recently, a former FBI agent concluded that Jamie Spears was spying on his daughter and surveilling her bedroom, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow>ET</a>.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.9411764705882><h2>Nicki Minaj vs. Tracy Chapman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1461505167.jpg><p>On Jan. 7, 2021, the legal battle between Nicki Minaj and Tracy Chapman over the former’s unauthorized sampling of Chapman’s song “Baby Can I Hold You?” finally came to an end. Back in 2018, Minaj publicly claimed she had “no idea” that her song sampled Chapman’s and begged the singer to give her rights so she wouldn’t have to delay her new album release. But Chapman repeatedly refused: and two years later, she’s accepted Minaj’s offer of $450,000 to settle.</p><p>“I am glad to have this matter resolved and grateful for this legal outcome which affirms that artists’ rights are protected by law and should be respected by other artists,” Chapman told&nbsp;<a href=#>NBC News</a>. “I was asked in this situation numerous times for permission to use my song; in each instance, politely and in a timely manner, I unequivocally said no. Apparently, Ms. Minaj chose not to hear and used my composition despite my clear and express intentions.”</p><p>While Minaj ultimately cut the song from her album, it was leaked and made its way around the internet nonetheless. With this legal ruling, further circulation of the song will be banned.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=16.133333333333><h2>FKA Twigs vs. Shia LaBeouf</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1661713586.jpg><p>In December 2020, the&nbsp;<a href=#>New York Times</a> revealed musician FKA Twigs’ lawsuit against actor ex-boyfriend Shia LaBeouf alleging “relentless abuse,” including sexual battery, assault and infliction of emotional distress. Her account to the Times alleges horrifying physical, psychological, and emotional abuse at the actor’s hands, and another one of his exes, Karolyn Pho, has come forward with similar stories as well.&nbsp;</p><p>“The lawsuit says that he kept a loaded firearm by the bed and that she was scared to use the bathroom at night lest he mistake her for an intruder and shoot her,” the&nbsp;Times reports of Twigs (born Tahliah Debrett Barnett’s). “He didn’t let her wear clothing to bed, and would spin a trifling disagreement — over an artist she liked and he didn’t, for example — into an all-night fight, depriving her of sleep.”</p><p>“In the lawsuit, Ms. Barnett and Ms. Pho said that Mr. LaBeouf did not like it if they spoke to or looked at male waiters; in an interview, Ms. Barnett said she learned to keep her eyes down when men spoke to her,” the piece continues.</p><p>“it may be surprising to you to learn that i was in an emotionally and physically abusive relationship,” Twigs wrote on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Twitter</a> the day the Times published its story. “it was hard for me to process too, during and after i never thought something like this would happen to me.”</p><p>In September 2023, the lawsuit was postponed until October 2024, per <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.8249258160237><h2>Kelly Clarkson vs. Starstruck Management</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1124938872.jpg><p>In a lawsuit we definitely did&nbsp;not&nbsp;see coming, Kelly Clarkson was forced to file suit against her former management company Starstruck Management Group, specifically agents Brandon Blackstock (her ex-husband) and Narvel Blackstock (his father). This came just four months after she first shocked us by filing for divorce after nearly seven years of marriage, though the legal action that’s followed has certainly shed some light on why they broke up.</p><p>Clarkson wasn’t the first to sue — that would be Starstruck, which <a href=#>claimed the singer owed them $1.4 million in unpaid management fees</a>. Clarkson hit back by responding that they’d never had an official contract and that neither Narvel nor Brandon was licensed to operate as her manager, then going on to quietly file a lawsuit in return for having <a href=#>defrauded her out of millions in earnings</a>, claiming Brandon had been charging her exorbitant fees for 13 years for his unlicensed management services.</p><p>As all this is going down, Clarkson and Blackstock are still trying to figure out their custody arrangement and spousal support too. Most recently, <a href=#>Blackstock’s legal team submitted an appeal</a> after he was ordered by the California Labor Commission to <a href=#>pay back the $2,641,374</a>.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9.8518518518519><h2>Erika Jayne and Tom Girardi vs. Edelson PC</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1462780994.jpg><p>In late 2020, Erika Girardi (AKA Erika Jayne of&nbsp;Real Housewives of Beverly Hills) <a href=#>shocked us by filing for divorce</a> from lawyer Tom Girardi after 21 years of marriage. After that, the shocks just kept on coming: Edelson PC, a class action firm, <a href=# rel=nofollow>filed a lawsuit against the couple</a> just a few weeks later, claiming the couple was “on the verge of financial collapse and locked in a downward spiral of mounting debts and dwindling funds,” <a href=# rel=nofollow>Us Weekly </a>reports.&nbsp;</p><p>“While Erika publicly filed for divorce this month, on information and belief, that ‘divorce’ is simply a sham attempt to fraudulently protect Tom’s and Erika’s money from those that seek to collect on debts owed by Tom and his law firm GK,” Edelson PC wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Tom and Erika are being sued for embezzlement and fraud, having allegedly embezzled settlement funds intended for families of victims of Lion Air Flight 610, which crashed in 2018. Per the lawsuit, they believe the&nbsp;Real Housewives&nbsp;star’s extravagant lifestyle is to blame for their spending, and Tom is accused of having used his clients’ assets to fund his family’s ventures.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=10.709484690067><h2>Meghan Markle vs. Associated Newspapers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1776753495.jpg><p>In October 2019, Meghan Markle <a href=#>filed a lawsuit against Associated Newspapers</a>, the publisher of British outlets like&nbsp;The Sun, for publishing a handwritten letter between her and her father in 2018. The Duchess alleges that these publications breached the Data Protection Act, misuse of private information, and copyright infringement. But they’ve attempted to claim in return that Meghan’s letter was in fact an official piece of royal communications intended for PR, and not an original work.</p><p>The letter in question was an emotional plea from Meghan to her father, Thomas Markle, asking him to stop speaking to media and stop posing for paparazzi pictures, telling him he was breaking her heart by continuing to exploit her like this. <a href=#>Meghan and her father remain estranged to this day</a>, with the letter’s publication acting as the final straw in her attempts to reach him surrounding the royal wedding.</p><p>By December 2021, the court sided with Markle, who <a href=#>released a statement following her legal victory.</a> “While this win is precedent-setting, what matters most is that we are now collectively brave enough to reshape a tabloid industry that conditions people to be cruel, and profits from the lies and pain that they create,” she said in statement.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.7261410788382><h2>Goop vs. California</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1688038057.jpg><p>Gwyneth Paltrow’s wellness company Goop was in some hot water back in 2018 when a group of officials from the California Food, Drug, and Medical Device (FDMD) Task Force filed a lawsuit against them for making unsubstantiated claims about the health benefits of some of their products — including <a href=#>the infamous vaginal jade egg</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>California prosecutors <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a> that Goop’s claims regarding this “detox egg,” like suggesting it could improve bladder control or prevent uterine prolapse, “were not supported by competent and reliable science.” Ultimately, the judge agreed, stating: “We will vigilantly protect consumers against companies that promise health benefits without the support of good science…or any science.”</p><p>Goop settled the lawsuit with a payment of $145,000 and a promise to refund any consumers who purchased the egg between January 12, 2017 and August 31, 2017.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=11.685920577617><h2>Kendall Jenner vs. Gregory Messer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-lawsuit.jpg><p>The story of the ill-fated Fyre Festival is a sordid tale. Basically, a bunch of wealthy people paid a ton of money to attend what was billed as the most exclusive, luxurious music festival on the planet. In reality, it was anything but luxurious, and the festival shut down after one day.</p><p>A $100 million class-action suit was quickly filed against the organizers, but soon after, another was filed against celebrities who acted as social media “Fyre starters” in advance of the event, per <a href=#>Wired</a>. Celebs like Bella Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Emily Ratajkowski, were all paid to promote the festival. A law professor told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Fortune</a> there is precedent for the charges, and though the case is still in court, if it goes against the celebrities, it could have a lasting impact on celebrity endorsements.</p><p>In May 2020, Jenner <a href=# rel=nofollow>paid a settlement</a> to Gregory Messer, who was in charge of Fyre Fest’s bankruptcy filing. She’d been paid $275,000 for a social media post promoting the event, but only gave a payment of $90,000.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=12.316544362909><h2>Janice Dickinson vs. Bill Cosby</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1819264623.jpg><p>In late November 2017, former supermodel Janice Dickinson, according to <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, filed a renewed defamation case against Bill Cosby, with a majority of her older lawsuit still in use. A California court of appeals also ruled that she could pursue legal recourse against Cosby’s lawyer, Marty Singer, for defamation.&nbsp;</p><p>The lawsuit&nbsp;stems&nbsp;from Dickinson coming forward in early 2017 with allegations that Cosby drugged and raped her in the 1980s. So, Singer, acting in the interests of Cosby, “sent demand letters that asserted that Dickinson’s story was ‘fabricated and is an outrageous defamatory lie.’ Further, Singer threatened to sue&nbsp;Good Morning America&nbsp;if the ABC show proceeded with a planned segment with Dickinson. The following day, Singer issued a public statement again repeating that Dickinson’s story of rape was a lie and different than what she had written in her own autobiography,” according to THR.</p><p>THR further reports that “Cosby brought a motion to strike her complaint under California’s anti-SLAPP statute, which provides early recourse for individuals targeted for First Amendment activity. After Cosby brought the motion and arguments were made,&nbsp;Dickinson attempted to amend her complaint to add Singer as a co-defendant. The trial judge wouldn’t allow this,” but&nbsp;the original ruling was slapped down by another judge, allowing Dickinson’s case to proceed.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=18.001812532367><h2>Ashley Judd & Rose McGowan vs. Harvey Weinstein</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1046914382.jpg><p>A&nbsp;<a href=#>New York Times&nbsp;</a>exposé&nbsp;published in early October of 2017 detailed three decades of numerous allegations of sexual harassment and assault by Harvey Weinstein, one of the most influential men in Hollywood. Those included claims by Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan, both of whom say they were targeted by Weinstein in 1997.</p><p>Judd first went public with her accusations in 2015, telling&nbsp;Variety for its&nbsp;Power of Women issue that an unnamed Hollywood mogul had asked her for a “meeting” in his hotel room and then tried to make her massage him and watch him shower. In the&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;piece, Judd finally admitted that man was Weinstein, telling the paper that she wondered at the time, “How do I get out of the room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein?” and that she “said no, a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at me with some new ask. It was all this bargaining, this coercive bargaining.”</p><p>That same year, Weinstein <a href=#>settled a sexual harassment claim</a> from Rose McGowan. The settlement was undisclosed at the time, but the&nbsp;Times reports he paid her $100,000 to “avoid litigation and buy peace.” McGowan chose not to comment on the&nbsp;Times‘ article, but after it was published, she tweeted a call for allies to stand up for the myriad women now accusing Weinstein of harassment and assault.</p><p>Late in October 2017, The Weinstein Company announced that Weinstein had been fired after more than a third of its all-male board stepped down and many of Weinstein lawyers and close advisers, including sexual assault advocate Lisa Bloom, began distancing themselves from him.&nbsp;</p><p>In March 2020, Weinstein was convicted of rape and sexual assault, receiving 23 years in prison, per <a href=# rel=nofollow>BBC</a>. The case for which Weinstein was convicted was unrelated to Judd and McGowan’s lawsuits.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.314990512334><h2>Kesha vs. Dr. Luke</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1243724462.jpg><p>The saga of Kesha versus Dr. Luke is a long and sad tale of lawsuit after lawsuit. But the most notable accusation took place in October 2014 when Kesha claimed the music producer raped her twice while also using his position to “intimidate and torment” her, per <a href=#>Vulture</a>. Since then, Kesha has filed motions and suits in an attempt to get out of her contract with Dr. Luke and Sony Music. She has further claimed that Sony knew about Dr. Luke’s alleged abuse.&nbsp;</p><p>By February 2016, a request for a preliminary injunction made by Kesha’s team was denied. In 2021, she lost another appeal in the defamation ruling, per <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>. In June of last year, Kesha and Dr. Luke finally settled the lawsuit after almost a decade, with the terms not disclosed to the public. “I am so full of light and excitement for the beautiful things to come, for shows to play, and art to make to share with you all,” the singer wrote on social media at the time, per the <a href=#>outlet</a>.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.8674698795181><h2>CBS vs. the Federal Communications Commission</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1506431053.jpg><p>Oh, the infamous&nbsp;wardrobe malfunction of the 2004 Super Bowl. Justin Timberlake ripped off part of Janet Jackson’s bustier, revealing her boob to the world.

CBS argued the FCC was being inconsistent and had overlooked similar if not worse things in the past. Ultimately, the court sided with CBS, and Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake are now bigger stars than ever.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9880952380952><h2>Kate Middleton vs. Closer Magazine</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/nztiyo8gx0nhu35x2bqv.jpeg><p>Back in 2012, French magazine Closer&nbsp;published topless photos of the Duchess of Cambridge, which they snapped without her knowledge while she was sunbathing at a private villa. The royal family sued the magazine, and the dispute was finally settled at the beginning of September 2017. <a href=#>TMZ</a> reports a judge ordered Closer to pay $119,000 in damages while the editor and owner are also responsible for paying $53,000 each in fines.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.9952><h2>Erin Andrews vs. Michael David Barrett & Marriott</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1874422060.jpg><p>In 2008, Michael David Barrett stalked ESPN anchor Erin Andrews to a hotel in Nashville where he filmed her through a peephole while she was naked, later uploading the video to the web. Andrews kept her lawsuit simple and direct; she went after Barrett and the owner of the specific Marriott hotel location that failed to protect her privacy. The court split the blame — 51 percent to Barrett and 49 percent to the hotel — and Andrews won a massive victory for women. She was awarded $55 million in 2016, <a href=#>ABC</a> reports.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.4491094147583><h2>Padma Lakshmi vs. Teamsters</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1730505679.jpg><p>Lakshmi filed a lawsuit against Boston Teamsters after they were reportedly verbally abusive during Top Chef filming in 2014. Lakshmi claimed the union drivers were “raining down racist, sexist and homophobic threats and slurs as staffers came to and left the set.” Specifically, she said they screamed at her, “You bitch! You slut! We’re gonna get you!” The teamsters were reportedly picketing on the set because they were upset the show had hired nonunion drivers. On Aug. 15, 2017, the Teamsters accused of harassment were found not guilty&nbsp;according to the<a href=#> Associated Press</a>. Though the judge seemed to recognize that harsh language was used, it was not enough to convict the men of a crime.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.6852459016393><h2>Keira Knightley vs. Daily Mail</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1928392532.jpg><p>Keira Knightley has always fielded criticism over her body (remember when they&nbsp;<a href=#>photo edited her boobs for the&nbsp;King Arthur&nbsp;poster</a>), but in 2007 Daily Mail went a step further, alleging she was to blame for the death of an anorexic teen. The Mail said Knightley misled the public by denying she had an eating disorder, leading to a teen’s death. Though <a href=# rel=nofollow>the judgment in Knightley’s favor was small</a>&nbsp;— just $6,000, which she donated to charity — the precedent was set that this particular kind of shaming wouldn’t be tolerated.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Lindsay Lohan vs. Grigor Balyan, overaggressive photographer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/c8kjxgj4hazsjmcjewyr.jpeg><p>In 2010 a celebrity photographer claimed he was injured when the car carrying Lindsay Lohan sped away outside a Hollywood club, injuring his foot.

Jennifer Lawrence was just one of the women who filed charges against the culprit, who ultimately pled guilty and went to prison.</p><p>The shocking part was the legal battles the victims had to wage against websites that refused to pull the images down. One porn site claimed Lawrence didn’t hold the copyright to the images since they weren’t selfies — this despite the fact that they were stolen from her personal iCloud account. Through a shared lawyer, more than a dozen women then took on Google, per <a href=#>Deadline</a>, threatening a $100 million suit if they didn’t act faster to pull down the images from all Google-owned and -hosted sites.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.3433147632312><h2>Sofía Vergara vs. Nick Loeb</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1244917303.jpg><p>A complex legal case was filed in 2015 when Sofía Vergara’s ex, Nick Loeb, sued for custody of two female embryos the couple had frozen in 2013. Vergara’s camp argued both parties reportedly agreed not to implant the embryos without consent from both sides. Loeb claimed he always intended to see the embryos brought to full term and that he would waive any of Vergara’s parental obligations.</p><p>After the case was thrown out, Loeb re-filed in 2017 in Louisiana, most likely because the state has strict laws protecting embryos.
