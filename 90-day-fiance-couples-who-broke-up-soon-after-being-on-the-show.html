A failure to do so&nbsp;means the foreign citizen will have to be deported. The minute the foreigners land on U.S. soil, the clock starts ticking. These people have to overcome cultural differences, language barriers, difficult family members and friends, among other obstacles to make the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">life-changing decision</a> of getting married.</p><p>Over the years, many relationships have endured the worst to blossom into happy marriages and beautiful families, which is great. However, other couples are not so fortunate, since we have also experienced numerous relationships and even marriages breaking within a very short period. As is the case with other relationships out there, most of the reasons for the&nbsp;end&nbsp;of a relationship on 90 Day Fiancé&nbsp;include cheating, breaking the law, parties engaging in shocking behavior, and the like.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here are 15 couples from&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé&nbsp;who unfortunately broke up soon after being on the show.</p><h2 id=ashley-and-jay-split-up-then-got-back-together><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Ashley And Jay Split Up, Then Got Back Together</span></h2><p>In season 6, Jay Smith and Ashley Martson met when Ashley was on vacation in Jamaica.
