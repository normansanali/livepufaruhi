There are plans in place for a redevelopment, which were orchestrated from four years ago, and that’s still happening.</p><p>“But this thing that’s gone viral now about a €1 million donation is just something someone put online without ever making contact with the club.</p><p>“They didn’t contact me and I’m the administrator... no-one contacted anyone from the club and the person who put it out is somebody who is not even really involved in the club.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-14-15.33.56.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000604050753.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/02/328877129_779445857065336_7825609937856366380_n.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in MMA</h2></p><p>Despite that, Sutcliffe praised his most famous student for previously sponsoring the club several times and insisted he will help them redevelop the venue at some point.</p><p>He added “We’re a big club but, like any boxing club, it’s very hard to keep any club open.</p><p>“Conor will be helping with the redevelopment of the club but not just now, because he has so many projects on.”</p><p>Since making his MMA debut back in 2008, McGregor has trained out of the Straight Blast Gym in Ireland under the tutelage of John Kavanagh who has helped him achieve great things in the sport.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/06/GettyImages-591931854.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/03/GettyImages-624076130.jpg><p>Before taking up MMA, McGregor learnt how to strike at Crumlin Boxing Club and he has always maintained a strong relationship with the gym despite his amazing success in combat sports.</p><p>The 34-year-old has sporadically returned to his old stomping ground over the years to train with Sutcliffe who he credits with teaching him the fundamentals of boxing that he still uses today.</p><p>McGregor told&nbsp;<a href=#>Irish Boxing</a> in 2020: “Phil Sutcliffe is a phenomenal boxing coach and during my time under Phil in Crumlin Boxing Club, I learned so many fundamentals that I still carry with me today.</p><p>“I learned so many shots off Phil and the coaching staff down there and the sparring with Phil Sutcliffe Jnr in my early days was phenomenal, it got me to that next level I feel.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraJqfrbavs45qamtpaGeDcK%2FRrqSloZ5ir7DEyKeeZpucqq9usMSnsGabn6O8s3nMnJ6rnZekv26wzqeYraGfo3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
