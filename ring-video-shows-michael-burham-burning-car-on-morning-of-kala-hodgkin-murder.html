He taped a strip of rubber to the glass door and left behind a fire extinguisher.</p><p>A minute later, the Ring camera recorded a&nbsp;car bursting into flames&nbsp;in the background.</p><p>That’s shortly after he allegedly killed Hodgkin, with whom he shared a daughter. According to federal court filings, he had been wanted on allegations that he’d raped Hodgkin at the time of her shooting death.</p><p>He eluded authorities for the next 11 days. On May 20,&nbsp;a Pennsylvania couple was reported missing along with their car. South Caroline&nbsp;police found them safe two days later, along with a note from Burham to his father.</p><p>By May 23, after a couple and their dog spotted him trespassing near their shed, police&nbsp;captured him&nbsp;following a two-hour chase through the woods nearby.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Burham escaped jail after he was accused of kidnapping a couple. <span class=credit>Cattaraugus County Sheriff's Office</span></figure><p>“I’m not sorry for what I did, however I do feel terrible about the children,” the note read, according to court filings.</p><p>He wrote that he had “quit drinking” on May 10 and apologized “for all the problems” he caused his family.</p><p>Burham has been a heavy drinker for years, according to a source who knows him well and asked to remain anonymous, citing safety concerns as the murder suspect remains at large.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Kala Hodgkin was allegedly gunned down by Burham in May. <span class=credit>Kala Hodgkin/Facebook</span></figure><p>“He drank a lot,” the source said. “From the time he woke up until he fell asleep, he had to have a beer in his hand. He also used cocaine over the last three or so years.”</p><p>Pennsylvania State Police, who are spearheading the manhunt, say Burham should be considered armed and dangerous.</p><p>The former&nbsp;Army reservist&nbsp;is believed to be a skilled survivalist and may be receiving aid while on the run, Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens told reporters Monday.</p><p>“We do believe that he is getting some assistance,” Bivens revealed during his remarks Monday afternoon. “We are prepared to prosecute anyone who does offer him assistance.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Footage from a Ring doorbell camera shows Burham on a woman’s porch before ‘allegedly torching her car in the driveway.’ <span class=credit>Fox News</span></figure><p>Police believe he is still in Warren County or one of its surrounding areas, and multiple witnesses have been relocated for their safety pending his capture, according to authorities.</p><p>Police have been on his trail since early Friday and previously told Fox News that they’d uncovered a series of possible campsites in the area and did not believe the suspect had traveled far.</p><p>The source, however, said while Burham does have significant survival skills, he would likely have trouble feeding himself over a sustained period.</p><p>“At some point we will force him to make a mistake, and when he does, we will use that to our advantage,” Bivens said.&nbsp;</p><p>U.S. Marshals joined the manhunt Saturday, announcing a reward of up to $9,500 for information leading to his capture.</p><p>The manhunt&nbsp;entered its fifth day Tuesday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Bmamlfp7avs4yvoJ2dn2LAqbvWrGSmoZOdrqa4jJusq6CRonqjwdGnoKefXZius3nOp2Smp6Kjtq%2BzjKidZqORoa5utM6dnqShnmK6tr7Dnqlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
