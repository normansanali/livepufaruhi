He did much of his 14-minute set from the stands of Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, while running through hits including “Starboy,” “The Hills,” “I Feel It Coming” and “Earned It” before making his way to the field with a massive group of bandaged backup dancers surrounding him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-Weeknd-Finally-Explains-the-Meaning-Behind-His-Bandaged-After-Hours-Character-4.jpg><p>The high-energy performance at the sporting event marked the biggest milestone in The Weeknd’s career thus far, fulfilling a goal he had since childhood.</p><p>“We all grow up watching the world’s biggest acts playing the Super Bowl, and one can only dream of being in that position,” the “In Your Eyes” crooner said in a <a href=#>statement released by the NFL</a> in November 2020. “I’m humbled, honored and ecstatic to be the center of that infamous stage this year.”</p><p>The Weeknd later revealed that he <a href=#>used $7 million of his own money</a> to set up a stage in the stands, keeping social distancing guidelines in mind amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It was tough to bring the vision to life with what we had at the time. We really wanted to be safe,” he said on the NFL Network on Sunday morning. “We really thought about the players and the workers, so we built the stage within the actual stadium.”</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2ssqa3zZ1knrCgoa6qutJmq6GdXaKyorrIp55mmpWdtq%2BwjKGgrGWSlrulrcaem2abmJa%2Foq%2FTnqlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
