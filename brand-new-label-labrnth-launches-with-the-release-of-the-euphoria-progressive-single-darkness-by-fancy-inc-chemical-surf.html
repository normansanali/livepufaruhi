This follows up Fancy Inc’s remix of “Phase Me” by WOOSUNG and their collaboration single with Flamber and Bruno Be titled “Let Your Body” featuring Nina Sanders, and also follows up Chemical Surf’s collaboration with Sharam Jey and Breaking Beattz for the Sharam Jey & Bakka (BR) remix of their track “Get Low”.</p><p>Fancy Inc are a Brazilian music producer duo consisting of Matheus Rodrigues and Adriano Dub. They were formed in 2014 but rose to fame in 2019 with a string of hit releases. Their most notable songs include “My Girl” in collaboration with Vintage Culture, which reached the top of the Beatport Dance Chart, “In The Dark” which reached number one on the US Billboard Dance Chart and was certified Platinum twice, and “Say My Name” with Bruno Be. These three tracks alone accumulated over 50 million plays across all digital platforms. Their success in the Progressive House genre led to official remixes for artists like David Guetta, Becky Hill, Joel Correy & MNEK and Robin Schulz. In 2021, they released the single “Free” in collaboration with Vintage Culture and Roland Clark, which reached the number one spot on Beatport’s main chart in just under two weeks. Their unique style has made them a reference in the industry and a go-to for collaborations with major labels. Watch this space!</p><p>As for Chemical Surf, they are a Brazilian brother duo composed of Lucas and Hugo Sanches. They are known for their high energy and rhythmic style, and have worked with notable artists such as Kaskade and Steve Aoki, as well as putting their own spin on popular songs like MEDUZA’s “Tell It To My Heart”. They have released music on a variety of labels such as Dim Mak, Spinnin’ Records, STMPD RCRDS, Musical Freedom, Armada, Sony, and Warner. They stand out in the electronic music scene by breaking the boundaries between genres and showcasing their high musical sensibility. They’re clearly a rising duo to keep an eye on as they start 2023 off with a bang – releasing the first-ever single on the LABRNTH label with Fancy Inc.</p><p>Written by Adriano Szancowski, Euan James Allison, Hugo Tassinari Sanches Gonzales, Lucas Tassinari Sanches Gonzales, and Matheus Castro Rodrigues, whilst it was produced by the artists themselves, “Darkness” is a powerhouse dance track set to alight dancefloors around the world with haunting melodies and an unstoppable bassline. Vocals, which come from Magnus, are on fire throughout, with a connection to the lyrics as well as a passionate delivery. The track starts off with atmospheric beats that warp around the vocal before the progressive bassline kicks in adding drama and tension around surging melodies, all before a super influential drop pulls in monumental dance beats determined to make one’s body move. Iconic and unforgettable, “Darkness” makes an impact on the listener even before you’re ready, making sure that the track becomes historical as the first-ever release on the new LABRINTH imprint label.</p><p>Talking about the track, Fancy Inc said: “We’re proud to be the first release on the new music label LABRNTH. Our new track, ‘Darkness’, is our collaboration with the talented musicians Chemical Surf and vocalist Magnus. They are brilliant artists and real friends, so the entire production process was a true labor of love. Through our production with Chemical Surf and Magnus’ outstanding vocals, we pushed ourselves to bring our audience the best possible performance, and we hope they agree. Cheers to a new year, a new label, and all new music in 2023.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Stream “Darkness” by Fancy Inc & Chemical Surf on Spotify here:</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>“Darkness”, by Fancy Inc & Chemical Surf, is available to download and stream right now across all platforms, via LABRINTH.
