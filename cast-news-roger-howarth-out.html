I wish RH nothing but the best.</p><p><span class=post-likes>21 Likes</span></p><p>This is a huge mistake. RoHo was one of the only good things GH had going for it.</p><p><span class=post-likes>14 Likes</span></p><p>I’m sorry for Roger Howarth to lose his job. But GH has too many characters in that nebulous age range. Austin really wasn’t needed. Just because someone is a good actor (and he is) doesn’t mean a show has a good part for you. Austin just didn’t click, and it really does feel like it’s a good time to cut their losses with the character. It was a very well-kept secret. I gasped at that scene.</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><p>Wow, I didn’t expect that. Such a shame. I will miss him. GH’s loss. Hopefully another soap hooks him in.</p><p><span class=post-likes>9 Likes</span></p><p>Sorry to hear Ro Ho is out, he is one of the more talented actors. I always enjoyed how he would interject his unique personality! Sadly, he was not utilized to his potential, which is GH’s loss and the viewer’s loss.</p><p><span class=post-likes>10 Likes</span></p><p>Also want to add kudos to the GH writers for not chickening out and having some miracle survival. This is a dark, violent show and violence has to have consequences to be impactful. I bet Dante is going to beat himself up a little over this for letting Austin waltz out of the police station. Dominic Z is great at those type of emotionally turbulent scenes.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>mittie</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>November 20, 2023, 9:08pm <span itemprop=position>10</span></span><p>RH was around long before some of those characters. He was great as Franco til Disney decided to kill Franco because of bad stuff years past. Big Mistake! IMO</p><p><span class=post-likes>12 Likes</span></p><p>I couldn’t get behind Franco, but I know a lot of people grew to like the character, especially with Liz. It just always made me cringe, but I respect your opinion.

Are they going to keep Mason who is another complete waste? Nothing against the actor but the character of Mason is just going nowhere, I hope he’s the next.

I got to the point where I liked Franco and Elizabeth, I was able to disassociate James Franco’s version from Roger’s, as though they were two different characters, but giving Howarth the role of Franco was a mistake, that was always going to be an uphill battle tough to overcome because of the character’s history, and taken as a whole, the character of Austin was a bust, he was a weak, uninspired, milquetoast character that lacked charisma or dynamism, he was just there, part of the scenery at GH. What a waste of such a great and talented actor.</p><p><span class=post-likes>7 Likes</span></p><p>They should get rid of Drew and several others——not Roger.</p><p><span class=post-likes>9 Likes</span></p><p>Cyrus is going to need a new Mob Doctor.
