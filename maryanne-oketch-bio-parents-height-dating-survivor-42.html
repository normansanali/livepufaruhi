The first season she watched fully was David vs. Goliath and soon she found the show to be “top dog!”.</p><p>When asked who she identifies concerning the former Survivor winner and non-winners, Maryanne hinted she might be playing a little bit of Sarah Lacina, Vecepia, Lauren Beck, Gabby Pascuzzi, and Debbie from season 32.</p><p>Looking back Maryanne said this one experience in life prepared her for the game.</p><p>This was when she had gone for her lifeguarding certificate because of this fear of water left by a nearly-drowning incident when she was a young child. Anyway, Maryanne shared she was the slowest swimmer there. Because she started late, everyone was younger than her and they did well. She on the other hand just failed and failed. Not wanting to give up so easily she kept pushing herself and on her seventh attempt, she finally got the timed swim. This very tenacity is what she said she would be relying on when surviving on the show.</p><h3><strong>Is Maryanne Oketch Dating Anyone?</strong></h3><p>Until Valentine’s Day in 2022, Maryanne Oketch had been single for the 24th Valentine’s Day in a row.

I aspire to be like her. She changed my life”, Maryanne’s mother must be proud hearing her daughter say all this.</p><p>Maryanne’s father, Timothy Oketch, on the other hand, is a professional engineer with more than 20 years of working experience and a doctorate, master’s, and bachelor’s in Transporation Engineering.</p><p>As per siblings, Maryanne has a sister, Akinyi Oketch, and a brother named Joel Oketch.</p><h3><strong>Maryanne Oketch Height</strong></h3><p>Maryanne Oketch stands around 5’4” tall.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Maryanne Oketch?</strong></h3><p>When the world knew Maryanne as the contestant of surviving reality television show in 2022, she was 24 years old.</p><h3><strong>Maryanne Oketch Job</strong></h3><p>Maryanne Oketch was introduced to audiences on Survivor 42&nbsp;as a McMaster University seminary student.
