Black Adam speaks with assurance and confidence, and when he looks at people, it’s as if he’s looking through them. This description is certainly true based on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">action-packed clips from the movie</a> which show him squaring off against the Justice Society of America who’ve been assigned to stop him. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aldis Hodge’s Hawkman</a> attempts to reel in the aggressive man with the powers of Egyptian gods, but Black Adam refuses to budge from his position.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/t8VuoDboct</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/HYRY7KM4lT</a></p>— Twitter Movies (@TwitterMovies) <a href=#>October 18, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=721 data-injectable=true>He also shared that Black Adam’s powers are fueled by rage and that he relies on his gut instinct. He doesn’t have any qualms about doing what he feels needs to be done, which doesn’t exactly sit well with the heroes. This was also a change of pace for Johnson, who’s accustomed to playing good guys — and even his characters who’re on the rougher side still usually have a heart of gold.</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>The actor said that he’s never played a character who’s as present in every moment and in every scene and that there’s a real intensity to him. In most cases with heroes — and sometimes even villains — there’s an internal struggle the character has in deciding what action to take. Black Adam will be more decisive about knowing what he wants and how best to get it.</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=804 data-injectable=true>Black Adam doesn’t pull its punches and there even was an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">R-rated version of Black Adam</a> at one point, unlike the theatrical release which will be PG-13, and it reportedly required a lot of cuts to get it there. This has inspired some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fans to request the more mature version of Black Adam</a>, and if it gains enough momentum, (and with Johnson so eager to please the fans) it could be released to the public.</p><p data-characters=33 data-current-count=33 data-injectable=false>Black Adam hits theaters Oct. 21.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9OhnGaqn5i4br7Er5yapKNitaq%2FjJ%2BYr6einsGmecGlmJyjXZaxormMramaoaRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
