He sang some of his own parts, but other parts were sung by a ghost singer. This is a common practice in film musicals, where actors may not have the vocal range or training to sing all of their own parts.</p><p>In the case of West Side Story, the ghost singer for Ansel Elgort was Robin de Jesus. De Jesus is a Broadway actor and singer who has starred in several musicals, including In the Heights and Hamilton. He was also the understudy for the role of Tony in the original Broadway production of West Side Story.</p><p>De Jesus’s vocals can be heard on several of the songs in the film, including “Something’s Coming,” “Maria,” and “Tonight.” His vocals are blended with Elgort’s vocals to create a seamless sound.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-ansel-elgort-win-any-awards-for-west-side-story></span>Did Ansel Elgort win any awards for West Side Story?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Ansel Elgort was nominated for several awards for his performance in West Side Story, but he did not win any.

However, it is important to note that the Academy Awards are voted on by a small group of people, and there are many factors that go into who is nominated. It is possible that Elgort’s performance was simply not seen by enough people to warrant a nomination.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyZmXqiutKeo2adnJy8s8CMnaZmmZyherCyjKGgrGWfrLtuv8innqKml2K2r3nWnqqtZaOesaZ50q2mq7FdmbalecCnqp6kXZq5qLvRrWSwoZ5irq%2FFjJqumqqUqHqnu9Fmrp6rpGLAqrDEZqqtp6KufA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
