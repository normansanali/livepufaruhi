When the dust settled, some fans wondered if, outside of the show, Angelina and Sammi are friends.</p><p>After vehemently refusing to participate in the Jersey Shore spin-off series, Sammi’s May 2023 debut came as quite a shock. And with Angelina being the person to bring her back, it's hard not to wonder if she actually had a hand in convincing <a href=#>Sammi to return</a> to the franchise, however long Sammi originally planned to stay.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram / @sammisweetheart</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are ‘Jersey Shore’ stars Angelina and Sammi friends?</h2><p>In the Season 6 finale, viewers learned that Angelina DMed the former reality star and didn’t tell the rest of the cast that she had done so. So, when the duo arrived at the group’s vacation rental and Sammi Sweetheart dropped the line, “Hey guys, sorry I’m late,” the Jersey Shore alums couldn’t stifle their surprise.</p><p>“Is this real?” a flabbergasted <a href=#>Pauly D</a> asked. “Are you a hologram? Is this AI?”</p><p>It appeared that Angelina convinced Sammi to make her first appearance on Family Vacation, so fans wondered if the two women are friends. And given Angelina's often rocky relationship with several of her castmates — we’re looking at you, <a href=#>Jenni “JWoww” Farley</a> — it’s a reasonable question.</p><p>While the women have never claimed to be BFFs, they’ve seemingly maintained a healthy friendship over the years. And Angelina prefers Sammi over some of her other co-stars.</p><p>During <a href=#>Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi</a>’s hiatus from Family Vacation, Angelina told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> that Sammi should replace Nicole. “I said this in the beginning — like, years ago — that [Sammi] should return, but she’s living her best life,” Angelina said at the time.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sammi distanced herself from her ‘Jersey Shore’ co-stars when she opted out of ‘Family Vacation.’</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Samantha “Sammi Sweetheart" (@sammisweetheart)</a></p></figure><p>When Sammi Sweetheart decided to forgo the opportunity of starring in Jersey Shore: Family Vacation in 2018, she fell out of contact with most of the cast.</p><p>“Some of the cast members have tried reaching out, but she hasn’t responded to them lately,” a source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> in October 2019. “They would really like to still be friends.”</p><p>Then, when Sammi revealed who her bridesmaids were for her wedding with her now-ex-partner <a href=#>Christian Biscardi</a>, viewers noticed that none of them were her former Jersey Shore co-stars.</p><p>While Sammi and Christian’s wedding plans eventually fell through, Pauly D and <a href=#>Vinny Guadagnino</a> revealed they didn’t receive invitations.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Sammi still friends with from the ‘Jersey Shore’ franchise?</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Ahead of the Jersey Shore: Family Vacation Season 6 premiere, Sammi Sweetheart was still on the rocks with her former co-stars. “I think it’s safe to say Sammi is no longer wanting to do this,” <a href=#>Deena Cortese</a> told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> in January.</p><p>Nicole also confirmed that the Jersey Store alum had blocked her on social media. “I don’t know what I did,” Nicole told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!
