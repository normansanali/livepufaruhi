Part of many “firsts” in the company, including being one of the first women to main event a pay-per-view show and compete in the inaugural womens’&nbsp;Hell in a Cell and Elimination Chamber matches,&nbsp;Banks reflected on how many of these moments are no longer firsts, but now part of WWE history.</p><p>“It’s so crazy that it’s not even a thought anymore,” Banks said. “It’s crazy it doesn’t have to be first times anymore. It’s just a ‘Raw’ and ‘SmackDown’ that women get to show exactly what they do best and put people in seats. That’s what I want to do every single week. To create so much history in a short amount of time, every year, I feel like I leave a stamp of history.”</p><p>Banks also spoke about playing Koska Reeves on <a href=# rel=noopener>The Mandalorian</a>&nbsp;and explained how she learned on the set that wrestling prepares talent for acting in an easy way.</p><p>“Wrestling is acting. It’s SNL. We are live, doing things on the fly,” Banks said. “Sometimes we get handed a script five minutes before we go out there, and you can’t memorize it right when it’s handed to you. We’re performing these things off the cuff and feeling. When it came to ‘The Mandalorian’ and transitioning from WWE, it was honestly so easy. Sometimes they would make changes on the fly and I wouldn’t stress, because Vince (McMahon) does that to me every week.”</p><p>Sasha Banks will team with Naomi in a Fatal 4-Way match&nbsp;for the WWE Women’s Tag Team Championship on night two of WrestleMania 38. Current champions Queen Zelina and Carmella will defend their titles against Banks and Naomi, Rhea Ripley and Liv Morgan, and Natalya and Shayna Baszler.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFxbm9qYGLAor%2FHmmSbmZ6gwG6%2F05qkqWWfm3qptdKtpqux</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
