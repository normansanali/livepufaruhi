place<br>Look in the mirror sometimes and see a troubled face<br>And then my tears roll down and hit the sink<br>Then I hold my head up high, I hope the Man upstairs<br>can hear my cry<br>All these questions deep inside my mind<br>Like if Jesus loved me, why he leave my side, mama<br>I’m still tryin’ to get the answer why<br>You were young, 45, and you had to die<br>I’m always tryin’ to help people out<br>And it’s them same people tryin’ to take food out my<br>mouth</p><p>(Fo’ real tho’) It seems like the more money I make<br>(Fo’ real tho’) The more drama y’all try to create<br>(Fo’ real tho’) And through I try to move into the<br>positive<br>(Fo’ real tho’) The more y’all don’t wanna let me live</p><p>When will you realize that I don’t owe you nothin’<br>Need to get up off your butt

God<br>So shower down on me, wet me with your love<br>I need you to take me and lift me up, oh, yeah</p><p>I gave 13 years of my life to this industry<br>Hit song or not, I’ve given all of me<br>You smile in my face and tell me that you love<br>But then before you know the truth, you’re so quick to<br>judge me<br>That’s alright, go ahead, keep talkin’<br>‘Cause I’mma hold my head up high and keep walkin’<br>And reach for the sky, focus on the plan<br>Rescue the kid with his paper a pen<br>And this is for the homies that we lost<br>Yo’, we cannot forget y’all, so the hats come off<br>We pour a little liquor out for the memory<br>I know y’all up there sittin’ on chrome in them pearly<br>streets<br>The street survivors before careful, stay alive<br>I’m prayin’ for your families, I hope you pray for<br>mine</p><p>(Fo’ real tho’) Used to be a time you wished me well<br>(Fo’ real tho’) It hurts to know you wanna see me fail<br>(Fo’ real tho’) And don’t forget I kept you out of<br>jail<br>(Fo’ real tho’) Where’s my arms when you needed to be<br>held</p><p>They turn they backs on you, who was there believin’<br>Who said your troubles were only for a season<br>In church

it<br>up<br>Thank God for my fans ‘cause through it all they show<br>me love<br>To my sister and to brothers<br>Tell me why can’t we just try to get along with one<br>another<br>And stop hurtin’ one another, fightin’ one another<br>Man, I pray to God He get my family back together<br>Let me see what wanna see, just to blind me<br>All of these luxuries, wine and dining<br>And then You push me out in front to get behind me<br>Then You sat me up by blessin’ me to bind me<br>I’m a grown man with kids now, stakes are high<br>Gotta go to church now to avoid the fight<br>Frankly, y’all to keep it
