And after posing for a series of shots with her new "toy boy" and his pubescent pals, the singer then took to the stage for an upbeat performance.</p><p>"Get a load of these little hunks I met last night @ the Bar Mitzvah," Minaj captioned the shot of her and her new young pals. "They were very ummm turnT," she added.</p><p>Videos of Minaj's appearance were shared via her young fans' Twitter accounts, where she can be heard giving some sage words of advice to her school-age audience.</p><p>"Get an education. Stay in school. And don't be a bum," Minaj told her eager admirers.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"And ladies, never let a man have to take care of you. Do you understand me? Be your own woman. Be your own person," she advised.</p><p>But despite being the older, confident lady, it was Minaj who was left dumbstruck moments later, as she asked the ages of the kids in the audience, and then asked party-boy Murstein how old he was.</p><p>"Old enough!" the cheeky teenager replied.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGanoZOgtm65yKeYo6tdpbKzss6rpKxlkal6cn%2BMspyaql2kuaW%2FjJuYq2WdnsG7wsChZGtoYWp%2FeYCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
