Summarizing the <b>project</b> means explaining the aims, outcomes, significance and benefits.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Define.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Justify.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Evaluate.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Approach.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Schedule.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Wrap.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Compensate.</li><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-should-a-cv-description-include></span>What should a CV description include?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>A personal <b>profile</b>, also known as a <b>CV summary</b>, is the opening statement of your <b>CV</b>. It is a short introduction which outlines your personal characteristics, telling the prospective employer what kind of a person you are, the attributes and qualities that you possess and the work experience that you have.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-projects-on-a-resume></span>What are projects on a resume?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>In addition to standard <b>resume</b> sections like education, skills and experiences, class <b>projects</b> is a section that can be included to showcase additional qualifications that are relevant to jobs in which you have interest in applying to.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-we-write-project-name-in-resume></span>Can we write project name in resume?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>You <b>can</b> preferably mention your <b>project name</b> and other <b>project</b> details in your <b>resume</b> if your <b>project</b> research is exactly relevant to your applied field. You <b>can</b> also include your <b>project name</b> and the short description of your <b>projects</b> in your <b>resume</b> if your <b>project</b> work is sparsely related to your applied position.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-personal-project-in-resume></span>What is personal project in resume?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>You could include a <b>personal project</b> on your <b>CV</b> if it has relevance to the job role. For example, if you are a developer and you’ve created a website or software outside of work, you might include this. Alternatively, you might include a <b>personal project</b> that helps to show desirable traits or skills.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-write-a-personal-project></span>How do you write a personal project?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><b>Ensure you document the following:</b><li class=TrT0Xe>Give a precise meaning of the goal of your <b>project</b>. Explain what you want to achieve, when, where, how and why you want to achieve this.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Describe what makes the <b>personal project personal</b>: the experiences, interests and ideas that <b>make</b> it important to you.</li><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-it-ok-to-mention-client-name-in-resume></span>Is it OK to mention client name in resume?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>The use of prestigious <b>client names</b> can help your <b>resume</b> for two reasons: 1) it give validity to your work; and 2) it serves as a keyword for recruiters searching for those who have worked with those <b>clients</b>.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-client-name-project></span>What is Client Name Project?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><b>Client Name</b> means an alphanumeric code assigned to a Customer by Google that identifies the Customer.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-client-project></span>What is client project?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>A customer, often also referred to as <b>client</b>, can be a person or an organization that orders and buys products or services that a business offers. In <b>project</b> management, the customer is the one defining the requirements of the <b>project</b> and often setting the parameters such as budget and deadlines.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-write-a-confidential-resume></span>How do you write a confidential resume?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><b><b>How to write a confidential resume</b></b><li class=TrT0Xe>Follow standard formatting. A <b>confidential resume</b> closely adheres to the same <b>format</b> as a standard <b>resume</b>.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Include contact information.</li><li class=TrT0Xe><b>Write</b> a professional summary.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Include an education section.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Detail your work experience.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>List your relevant skills.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Consider including a disclaimer.</li><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-say-communication-skills-on-a-resume></span>How do you say communication skills on a resume?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>However, you can’t just list “<b>communication skills</b>” in your <b>skills</b> section and call it a day. You should be including <b>communication skills</b> on your <b>resume</b> with more context. Simply using <b>phrases</b> like “excellent written and verbal <b>communication skills</b>” serves little to no value on a <b>resume</b>.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-confidentiality-a-skill-or-quality></span>Is confidentiality a skill or quality?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>These three words – <b>confidentiality</b>, discretion and judgement – therefore are an expected and vital <b>skill</b> for the administrative professional. Administrative professionals are expected to have <b>confidentiality</b> as a core <b>skill</b>; you might say it “goes with the territory”.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-put-confidential-work-on-your-resume></span>How do you put confidential work on your resume?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Rather than disclosing any <b>confidential</b> details — such as techniques used or client names — focus on the value that you brought to the process. <b>Describe</b> the position in terms of technologies, size or objectives and refer to your <b>job</b> responsibilities and achievements.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-non-disclosure-the-same-as-confidentiality></span>Is non disclosure the same as confidentiality?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>There is no difference between <b>a non</b>–<b>disclosure</b> agreement (<b>NDA</b>) and a <b>confidentiality</b> agreement. <b>Non</b>–<b>disclosure</b> and <b>confidentiality</b> agreements both protect <b>confidential</b> information from being shared with third parties.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-say-you-signed-an-nda></span>Can you say you signed an NDA?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Yes, unless specified otherwise, <b>you can</b> share that <b>you signed an NDA</b>. <b>You</b> however <b>can</b> not share whatever the <b>NDA</b> is in regards to.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happens-if-you-break-an-nda></span>What happens if you break an NDA?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>An <b>NDA</b> is a civil contract, so <b>breaking</b> one isn’t usually a crime. In practice, <b>when</b> somebody <b>breaks</b> a <b>non-disclosure agreement</b>, <b>they</b> face the threat of being sued and could be required to pay financial damages and related costs.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-common-are-non-disclosure-agreements></span>How common are non-disclosure agreements?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><b>Nondisclosure agreements</b>, or NDAs, which are increasingly <b>common</b> in employment <b>contracts</b>, suppress employee speech and chill creativity. New data shows that over one-third of the U.S. workforce is bound by an <b>NDA</b>. These <b>contracts</b> have grown not only in number but also in breadth.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-refuse-to-sign-a-non-disclosure-agreement></span>Can you refuse to sign a non-disclosure agreement?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Employers must be prepared to terminate any employee who <b>refuses to sign</b> the <b>agreement</b>. <b>If</b> an employer allows even <b>one</b> employee to <b>refuse</b> and remain employed, the <b>agreements signed</b> by the other employees will not be legally binding.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46hprBlpKR6uL7IrZxmqKKkt6av02abnquTp7axwMiopWahnmKwt3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
