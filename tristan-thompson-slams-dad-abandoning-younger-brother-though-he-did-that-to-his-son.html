Previously, Tristan disclosed that he had no communication with Trevor and lacked an address to serve him with notice of the guardianship hearing. Tristan reiterated to the court that he remains unaware of his father's current whereabouts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Before Andrea Marie Brooks, the proposed ward's biological mother, died on January 5, 2023, she obtained sole custody of [Amari] in July of 2014. Trevor Douglas Thompson was ordered to pay child support to Andrea Marie Brooks as a result of the same proceeding which granted Andrea Brooks sole custody,” the court documents state. “Since then, Trevor Douglas Thompson has effectively abandoned the proposed ward; he failed to pay any child support despite the court order and has not been in contact with the [Amari] or Andrea Marie Brooks since July 2014.”</p><p>They added, “[Trevor] has done nothing to support or raise the proposed ward since then and has relinquished all rights to have any say in the proposed ward's care.”</p><p>Maralee Nichols, the woman whom Tristan shares his youngest child with, has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vocal about the fact that the NBA star doesn’t want a relationship</a> with their son.
