WWE gave her a good look, but things didn’t pan out for her. Years later, after she was fired from Impact Wrestling while she was their World Champion, <a href=#>she separated from her husband Daga</a>. There were also<a href=#> rumors that she cheated on him on top of it all</a>.</p><p>On the most recent <a href=#>K100 podcast</a>, Konnan hosted Hugo Savinovich to discuss Ric Flair’s presence in the Dominican Republic, Impact’s rebranding to TNA, Rey Mysterio, Vampiro, Juventud Guerrera, and various other subjects. Konnan also shared his opinions on several wrestling matters.</p><p>Konnan made it clear that he doesn’t think that Tessa Blanchard will be back in AAA. This comes after her public split with Daga, who is still a wrestler there. Konnan also confirmed the cheating rumors that were going around about Blanchard.</p><p>“No. Why would I bring her in bro? She was very disrespectful. She was like, ‘Oh, the only reason I’m in f*cking Mexico is because of Daga.’ Really, okay, and (she said) ‘Why do you guys do this? Why do you guys do that?’ I go, ‘Because, newsflash, this is Lucha Libre, not U.S. wrestling’, and bro, it would be very uncomfortable after the way they (Blanchard & Daga) got separated that she’d be in the same dressing room with him, and then I don’t want to put him in that position. They were married. She hooked up with some other guy, and he found out, like, one of the boys”</p><p>Tessa Blanchard is not finished yet. She joined the JROTC, and she is still doing what she can. That being said, she still has a lot of work to do, because there were plenty of burned bridges along the way.</p><p>Tessa Blanchard has <a href=#>not appeared for another pro wrestling</a> company since she was released from Impact Wrestling. That almost changed, because <a href=#>there was an offer for Blanchard to work with the NWA</a>. Keep checking back with <a href=#>Ringside News</a> for more.</p><p>What’s your take on Tessa Blanchard’s status in pro wrestling? Would you like to see her sign somewhere?
