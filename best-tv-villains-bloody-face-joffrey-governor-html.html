He may not haunt your dreams, but this kind of weasel will haunt your actual life. His C.V. of villainy is packed: His questionable pro–Paunch Burger agenda. His <a href=#>miniature-golf outfit</a>. His unauthorized usage of Leslie Knope’s toilet. But it was the decision to ruin Leslie’s wedding that makes orthodontist and Pawnee city councilman Jeremy Jamm the absolute worst villain of the year — and by that we mean best villain. Not only did Jamm jeer Leslie as she walked down the aisle by singing, “Here comes the boo! All dressed in boo!” he also threw stink bombs. Jamm is your moronic little brother all grown up and in a position of authority — a position he seemingly occupies solely because it allows him to thwart and taunt opponents with his catchphrase <a href=#>“You just got Jammed!”</a> There has never, ever been a bigger gnat in need of a smack, but like Leslie, all you’ll probably ever get to do is push him into a pool. Justice not served.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-38b9153abab918d2c1ff504e095a27ee-5-0-0@published data-word-count=5><span><strong>Best (Worst?) of the Rest</strong><br></span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-38b9153abab918d2c1ff504e095a27ee-6-0-0@published data-word-count=33>2.
