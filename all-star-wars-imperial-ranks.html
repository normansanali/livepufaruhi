Both the Imperial Army and Navy are split into divisions with ranks assigned to members to detail their role within the organization. Just like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">characters in Star Wars have different looks</a>, they also have different roles.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>Here is a list of all the ranks we’ve seen throughout the series, however, these are not technically seen as cannon post Disney’s acquisition of LucasFilm in 2012. Despite this, they’re the best information we have on the Imperial ranks to date and you can check out how they work below.</p><h2 id=h-all-imperial-ranks data-injectable=false>All Imperial Ranks</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Moff_Tarkin-revenge-sith-cameo-565x360.png><h3 id=h-midshipman-officer-candidate data-injectable=false>Midshipman / Officer Candidate</h3><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=247 data-injectable=false>The lowest roles in the Imperial ranks, these two roles for the Navy and Army respectively represent trainees who have ambitions of eventually leading their own ship. These soldiers are above regular stormtroopers but below the other ranked roles.</p><h3 id=h-ensign-second-lieutenant data-injectable=false>Ensign / Second Lieutenant</h3><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>Further on the road to leading their own crew, Ensign’s or Second Lieutenant’s is the title given to represent those members of the Imperial army who are on their way to manning their own ship or platoon.</p><h3 id=h-sublieutenant data-injectable=false>Sublieutenant</h3><p data-characters=112 data-current-count=112 data-injectable=false>A Sublieutenant is a role within the Imperial Navy that represents an ensign who is undergoing command training.</p><h3 id=h-lieutenant data-injectable=false>Lieutenant</h3><p data-characters=97 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>Lieutenant is a ranked used in the military or police given to low-ranking commissioned officers.</p><h3 id=h-captain data-injectable=false>Captain</h3><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>The captain is a title used to represent those within a leadership position within the Imperial Army.</p><h3 id=h-lieutenant-commander data-injectable=false>Lieutenant Commander&nbsp;</h3><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>A lieutenant Commander is an individual climbing the ranks but currently between the roles of Lieutenant and Commander. As the title implies, this soldier is the leader of other Lieutenant officers.</p><h3 id=h-major data-injectable=false>Major</h3><p data-characters=100 data-current-count=100 data-injectable=false>Typically, battalion commanders, Major is the role that can be achieved between Captain and Colonel.</p><h3 id=h-lieutenant-colonel data-injectable=false>Lieutenant Colonel</h3><p data-characters=118 data-current-count=218 data-injectable=false>A Lieutenant Colonel is a member of the Imperial Army who is responsible for the forces in the absence of the Colonel.</p><h3 id=h-commander data-injectable=false>Commander</h3><p data-characters=118 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>Commander is a Navy rank that describes the individual in command of their task force or group within the battlefield.</p><h3 id=h-captain-colonel data-injectable=false>Captain / Colonel</h3><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>The ranks of Captain and Colonel are similar and describe the individual in a leadership position as the head of either their Army or Navy outfit.</p><h3 id=h-captain-of-the-line-high-colonel data-injectable=false>Captain of the Line / High Colonel</h3><p data-characters=122 data-current-count=122 data-injectable=false>These two roles are similar to Captain / Colonel, however, they command superior positions and a larger force of soldiers.</p><h3 id=h-commodore-brigadier data-injectable=false>Commodore / Brigadier</h3><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>These two roles represent the members of the Imperial forces in charge of commanding multiple forces, in the case of the Navy, groups of ships, and the army Brigades.</p><h3 id=h-rear-admiral-major-lieutenant data-injectable=false>Rear Admiral / Major Lieutenant</h3><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true>Again, as we step up in rank the commanding roles of the individual increase further with the main difference being the size of the forces they represent.</p><h3 id=h-vice-admiral data-injectable=false>Vice Admiral</h3><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>The next in command under the Admiral, if the Admiral is absent then the Vice Admiral will take control. In Star Wars: The Last Jedi we meet Vice Admiral Holdo who is likely the most prominent character with the rank of Vice-Admiral.</p><h3 id=h-admiral-general data-injectable=false>Admiral / General</h3><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>Senior commanding positions of their representative sectors. The General is usually regarded as the leader of the army forces, while the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Admiral is a flag officer responsible for the high-level military command</a> of battle groups or fleets. You can’t speak of Admirals without mentioning Admiral Ackbar. The first person donning the role that we meet and likely the most beloved.</p><h3 id=h-fleet-admiral-high-general data-injectable=false>Fleet Admiral / High General</h3><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>As the name suggests, a Fleet Admiral is the person responsible for commanding each of the Admirals ruling their own fleet. The High General is responsible for coordinating front-line corps and armies and has mostly a non-combat position. While we don’t see many Fleet Admiral’s within the films, the two most notable are Sartan and Jok Donassius. The role of High General is a Legends exclusive position.</p><h3 id=h-high-admiral-surface-marshal data-injectable=false>High Admiral / Surface Marshal</h3><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>The High Admiral is a position designated by the Moff and Grand Moff for their highest-level subordinate. Similarly, Surface Marshal is also given out by those with a Moff title. There aren’t many named characters who boast these roles within the films, furthermore, High Admiral is Legends only rank.</p><h3 id=h-moff data-injectable=false>Moff</h3><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true>Moff is a select governor rank in the Sith Empire that is in command of the larger Imperial forces both Navy and Army. While newer to the Star Wars canon, the Mandolorian’s Moff Gideon is one of the most well-known characters to don the rank. Unlike many other Moffs, Gideon takes to the front lines to wield his newly acquired Dark Saber.</p><h3 id=h-grand-moff data-injectable=false>Grand Moff</h3><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>Grand Moff’s are those in charge of regions with multiple Moff ranked peers under their command. In Star Wars, the most notable of all the Grand Moff’s is the very first in history, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin who was promoted to the position by Emperor Palpatine during the original trilogy.</p><h3 id=h-grand-admiral-grand-general data-injectable=false>Grand Admiral / Grand General</h3><p data-characters=539 data-current-count=837 data-injectable=false>These Grand Admiral and Grand General positions are the highest possible in the Imperial Ranks are report directly to the Emporer himself. They have executive control of their respective sector and there are no more than 12 of each at a time. Within the Star Wars films, Cassio Tagge was promoted to Grand General by Emporer Palpatine following the Battle of Yavin. The Grand Admiral, however, is a role that has only had named characters assume within the Legends cannon with the most notable person to hold this position, Malcor Brashin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKWkXajBor6MsJirq12eurGx0aKYpWWilrusv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
