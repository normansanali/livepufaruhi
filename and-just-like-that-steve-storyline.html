Now, on the series' revival, the lovable bar owner has been unrecognizable to fans in the few scenes he has, with the now absent-minded character mostly taken a backseat to his wife's affair with nonbinary comedian Che.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Last week's episode saw Miranda try to reignite her marriage after being ghosted by Che. In an awkward redux of the kitchen hookup, Steve seems to forget how to pleasure his wife, and a disappointed Miranda declares their sex life dead and goes back to Che. Viewers have taken to Twitter to argue that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thecut.com/2022/01/sex-and-the-citys-steve-deserves-better.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Steve deserves better" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Steve deserves better</a>, pointing out that he hasn't had a real chance to communicate with Miranda.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/01/and-just-like-that-steve-miranda data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanity Fair" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Vanity Fair</a> interview, And Just Like That... executive producers Julie Rottenberg and Elisa Zuritsky, who both wrote for SATC, revealed that they knew Miranda's affair would be divisive, with the some of the show's crew even printing up Team Steve and Team Miranda buttons during production. (Eignenberg reportedly picked Team Miranda).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We love Steve," Zuritsky explained, debunking theories that the writers had a grudge against the character. "We are really invested in the Steve-ness of him. He’s so full of life, and the Steves out there are good guys."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"But Miranda’s journey is representing another reality out there, which a lot of people go through—the reevaluations and transitions in life," added Rottenberg. "Grown couples grow apart, and people come to epiphanies about what their spouse is or isn’t fulfilling for them. Miranda’s story was very representative of a certain path that a lot of women find themselves on."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We didn’t set out to make virtuous characters necessarily," Zuritsky said. Even beloved people have crises. Even moral, generally wonderful people make choices that aren’t necessarily admirable or virtuous. But they do them anyway because they’re going through something, or they’re working through a crisis."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She continued, "sometimes your friends make choices that you might not agree with or that might be concerning, but you sort of have to let them make their own choices. Sometimes it’s hard."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The writers also addressed Steve and Miranda's relationship going forward, and whether they'll have an actual conversation about Miranda's affair and the state of their marraige. Zuritsky assured, "You’re going to get that scene."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/81e105b4-86bd-4dab-a1f8-e00063b9e433_1609381211.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" title="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Quinci LeGardye is an LA-based freelance writer who covers culture, politics, and mental health through a Black feminist lens.
