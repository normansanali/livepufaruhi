It might not be as splashy as Ryan Reynolds’ incoming threequel, but there’s a real chance X-Men ’97 could be one of the finest entries in the MCU’s Phase Five.</p><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=175 data-injectable=false>But what is there to know about the show that’s been nearly 20 years in the making? Let’s don our Cerebro helmets and telepathically track down some answers…</p><h2 id=h-what-characters-are-set-to-return-in-x-men-97 data-injectable=false>What characters are set to return in X-Men 97?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/X-Men-97-main-team.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/X-Men-97-Magneto.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/X-Men-97-Cable-and-company.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/X-Men-97-villains.jpg><p data-characters=584 data-current-count=759 data-injectable=true>When our first look at the series was shared at Comic-Con 2022, we immediately discovered that the X-Men ’97 team would be much as we remember it, with the roster of heroes including Wolverine, Rogue, Jubilee, Beast, Gambit, Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Storm. Even better, many of the original cast are reprising their roles — namely, Cal Dodd, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lenore Zann</a>, George Buza, Adrian Hough, Catherine Disher, Chris Potter, and Alison Sealy-Smith. The role of Jubilee will now be voiced by Holly Chou, however, with OG actress Alyson Court playing another, currently unknown, character.</p><p data-characters=521 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>Among the other notable inclusions is Mister Sinister (Christopher Britton), who will serve as the main villain of the piece. Magneto (Matthew Waterson) is also back, but this time his suit looks a little different, drawing from his 1980s comics design. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunspot will also make his debut</a> in this continuity, voiced by Gui Agustini. He’ll be joining the line-up alongside other fan-favorites, Nightcrawler, Bishop, and Cable. What’s more, Jean Grey clone <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Madelyne Pryor aka the Goblin Queen</a> is also in the mix.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What’s the storyline of X-Men ’97?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/rogue-x-men-animated-series.jpg><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=844 data-injectable=true>When I say this show is a direct continuation of the original series, I really mean it. Seemingly unafraid to put off a new generation of viewers, X-Men ’97 will pick up right where X:TAS season 5 left off: with Professor X being whisked off into space by the Shi’ar Empire to save his life. This means that Charles Xavier won’t be the leader of the team in the new show, Magneto will. Ergo the nifty change of threads. Expect the fact that their former enemy is now their boss to cause a lot of conflict within the X-Mansion.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>In addition to the insidious machinations of Mister Sinister, the X-Men will also come up against familiar foes such as the Sentinels and the Hellfire Club, with Emma Frost and Sebastian Shaw set to be key characters. Someone else who is worth keeping an eye on is Val Cooper, a governmental liaison for mutant affairs that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">showrunner Beau DeMayo teases</a> has “an agenda” all of her own that will “slowly make itself known.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>When will X-Men ’97 release on Disney Plus?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=532 data-current-count=832 data-injectable=false>X-Men ’97 has been confirmed to hit Disney Plus this March 20, kicking off a first season that will consist of 10 episodes. But the fun doesn’t stop there, as we already know that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a second season is in the works</a> too. With any luck, that could follow in 2025. It’s unclear if Marvel intends for the show to stretch into a third season or not. Either way, ’90s kids, you can rest assured that you’ll be riding this nostalgia wave for the next couple of years. Cue that opening electric guitar riff…</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZJygkaeupMDEq6pmmaKaeqK8z56Yq6GenHqquoyxZKadnmKGeHnAp5tmr5iau26wzp6qZqGkYr%2BmuMSaqp5ln6N6pbXSp5yyZaChwrR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
