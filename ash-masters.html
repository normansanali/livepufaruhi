Ash's first Pokémon, <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a>, was given to him by <a href=# title="Professor Oak (anime)">Professor Oak</a> after he woke up late on the day he was set to get his first Pokémon. Although at first Pikachu didn't listen to Ash, after risking himself to protect his Pokémon, he earned Pikachu's trust, and the two have been inseparable ever since. On his first day of being a Trainer, Ash saw <a href=# title="Ho-Oh (anime)">Ho-Oh</a> in the sky, although at the time he didn't know the Pokémon's name. While still traveling in <a href=# title=Kanto>Kanto</a>, Ash caught a <a href=# title="Charmander (Pokémon)">Charmander</a>, who happily obeyed him until he evolved into a <a href=# title="Charmeleon (Pokémon)">Charmeleon</a> and <a href=# title="Ash's Charizard">Charizard</a>. After showing love and care towards his Charizard, despite Charizard's disobedience, Ash's Charizard regained full loyalty towards his trainer. While staying in <a href=# title=Alola>Alola</a>, Ash took care of <a href=# title=Nebby>Nebby</a> until it became a <a href=# title="Solgaleo (Pokémon)">Solgaleo</a>. Ash also obtained <a href=# title="Pikashunium Z">Pikashunium Z</a>, which allows Pikachu to use the <a href=# title=Z-Move>Z-Move</a> <a href=# title="10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt (move)">10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt</a>. He later became the first <a href=# title="Pokémon Champion">Champion</a> of Alola. While participating in the <a href=# title="World Coronation Series">World Coronation Series</a>, Ash caught a <a href=# title="Ash's Dragonite">Dragonite</a>, a <a href=# title="Ash's Gengar">Gengar</a> who can <a href=# title=Gigantamax>Gigantamax</a>, a <a href=# title="Ash's Lucario">Lucario</a> who can <a href=# title="Mega Evolution">Mega Evolve</a>, a <a href=# title="Ash's Sirfetch'd">Sirfetch'd</a>, and a <a href=# title="Ash's Dracovish">Dracovish</a>.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=The_Classic_Thunderbolt><a href=# title="Special event">The Classic Thunderbolt</a></span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/d/dd/Ash_party_Masters.png/270px-Ash_party_Masters.png decoding=async width=180 height=252 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>While training for the <a href=# title="Masters Eight Tournament">Masters Eight Tournament</a>, Ash somehow ended up on <a href=# title=Pasio>Pasio</a>. By the time the <a href=# title="Player character">player</a> (<a href=# title=Scottie>Scottie</a> or <a href=# title=Bettie>Bettie</a>) and <a href=# title=Tina>Tina</a> find Ash, he has passed out due to hunger. The player and Tina take Ash to <a href=# title=Lear>Lear</a> to feed him, and after recovering his strength, Ash asks Lear where he is. After Lear explains what Pasio is to Ash, Lear asks him if he is confident in his battling skills. Ash shows off his entire team that he had during <i><a href=# title="Pokémon Journeys: The Series">Pokémon Journeys: The Series</a></i>, which impresses Lear. Ash asks Lear if he could stay on Pasio to train for the Masters Eight Tournament, which Lear allows. Lear has to leave and attend to other business, so he tells Ash to ask the player or Tina if he has further questions about Pasio. Before Lear leaves, Ash asks him if they can battle another time when Lear isn't busy, to which Lear agrees.</p><p>Later, the player battles Ash to demonstrate what a <a href=# title="Sync move">sync move</a> is. Ash then has a battle against Tina, which Ash wins by successfully performing his first sync move with his <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a>. However, Tina fails to perform a sync move with her <a href=# title="Flareon (Pokémon)">Flareon</a> during the battle, and Ash wonders why that is. Tina shrugs it off, saying that they just need more practice. Pikachu tries to cheer up Flareon, only for Flareon to scare him away. After Flareon attacks Tina and runs away, Ash asks if Tina and her Flareon usually fight. Tina says that Flareon never fought with her when he was an <a href=# title="Eevee (Pokémon)">Eevee</a>, but he has become a bit feisty ever since he evolved. Ash tells Tina that her Flareon is going through a rebellious stage. He explains that he has met all kinds of Pokémon throughout his <a href=# title="Pokémon journey">journey</a>, and he has been through a <a href=# title="Ash's Charizard">similar situation</a> to what Tina is going through. He just had to start telling his Pokémon how he felt, that he wanted to get along with them, and that allowed them to understand each other better. Ash adds that he and Pikachu also had their difference when they first met and assures Tina that she and Flareon will be fine because Flareon is important to her. The player, Ash, and Tina then head out to find Flareon.</p><p>After searching for Flareon for a while with no success, Tina starts to suspect that he was stolen by some of the <a href=# title="Villainous team">bad people</a> on the island. Suddenly, <a href=# title="Team Break">Team Break</a> shows up saying that Tina will never get her Flareon back. For Ash's benefit, Tina explains that they're a group of Trainers who mess with their tournaments and steal people's Pokémon. Ash then asks Team Break what they meant, and they reveal that Tina's Flareon has joined them. The player and Ash battle Team Break to get Flareon back, but Ash has difficulty going all out against a friend's Pokémon and the player's Pikachu is knocked out by Team Break's other Pokémon. Tina is distraught at this turn of events, but Ash encourages her to not give up and tell Flareon how she feels. After she tells Flareon her feelings, Flareon is moved, and Team Break is annoyed that Flareon is still loyal to his Trainer. They send a <a href=# title="Crobat (Pokémon)">Crobat</a> to knock him out, but Ash takes the attack to protect Flareon. Ash tells Flareon that he's Tina's partner and Ash knows he hates being apart from her, prompting Flareon to return to her side. Once Flareon reunites with Tina, Ash and Pikachu knock out Team Break's Crobat with ease. Team Break doesn't want to give up just yet, but Ash sends out his full team to challenge them, causing them to chicken out and flee. Ash, the player, and Tina celebrate their victory.</p><p>Later, Ash guesses that Flareon was just jealous and thought that Tina was going to be taken away from him because he lost to Pikachu. Ash then invites Tina to battle again to cheer her up from the day's events, and the two proceed to battle.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Blazing_Battle_with_Ash><a href=# title="Special event">Blazing Battle with Ash</a></span></h3><p>While walking through <a href=# title="Centra City">Centra City</a>, the <a href=# title="Player character">player</a> (<a href=# title=Scottie>Scottie</a> or <a href=# title=Bettie>Bettie</a>), Ash, and <a href=# title=Tina>Tina</a> notice a crowd has gathered to watch an announcement that <a href=# title=Lear>Lear</a> is making. He announces a single battle tournament called the "Single Master Challenge Cup" for Trainers who just arrived on Pasio, with the winner being able to challenge the leader of the team that won the first-ever <a href=# title="Pokémon Masters League">PML</a>. This shocks the whole group, especially after Ash remembers that the player was the leader of the team that won the first PML tournament. Ash wonders why the tournament is for single battles instead of Pasio's standard team battles; Tina guesses that it's because the tournament is for Trainers who are new to Pasio, and they'll be able to do better in a battle format they're used to. Tina and Ash both decide to enter the tournament, with Ash declaring that he wants to have a serious battle with the player on a big stage.</p><p>The first round of the tournament begins, with Ash's first opponent being Rochelle from <a href=# title="Lilycove City">Lilycove City</a> in <a href=# title=Hoenn>Hoenn</a>. Ash first sends out <a href=# title="Ash's Sirfetch'd">Sirfetch'd</a> against Rochelle's <a href=# title="Salamence (Pokémon)">Salamence</a>. During the battle, Ash recalls Sirfetch'd due to Salamence attacking in the air and sends out <a href=# title="Ash's Dragonite">Dragonite</a> to counter. Dragonite manages to knock out Rochelle's Salamence. Rochelle then sends out her <a href=# title="Glalie (Pokémon)">Glalie</a>, who knocks out Dragonite. Ash sends Sirfetch'd back out to defeat Glalie, who is then defeated by Rochelle's <a href=# title="Banette (Pokémon)">Banette</a>. Both are down to one Pokémon left, with Ash sending out <a href=# title="Ash's Gengar">Gengar</a> as his last Pokémon. Both Pokémon seem to be evenly matched until Ash <a href=# title=Gigantamax>Gigantamaxes</a> his Gengar, defeating Rochelle's Banette and winning him the battle.</p><p>Ash's next opponent is Axel from <a href=# title="Hau'oli City">Hau'oli City</a> in <a href=# title=Alola>Alola</a>. Ash has his <a href=# title="Ash's Dracovish">Dracovish</a> battle against Axel's <a href=# title="Kommo-o (Pokémon)">Kommo-o</a>, and Dracovish knocks it out. Axel then sends out his <a href=# title="Salazzle (Pokémon)">Salazzle</a>, which poisons Dracovish, so Ash recalls it. Ash then sends out <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a> to battle, with Pikachu's speed overwhelming Axel's Salazzle, leading it to be knocked out. Axel sends out his last Pokémon, <a href=# title="Tsareena (Pokémon)">Tsareena</a>. Ash has Pikachu attack Tsareena with <a href=# title="Thunderbolt (move)">Thunderbolt</a>, but is surprised when Axel reveals that his Tsareena is immune to <a href=# class=mw-redirect title=Electric>Electric</a>-type moves. Tsareena then knocks out Pikachu. Ash decides to send out his <a href=# title="Ash's Lucario">Lucario</a> to finish things off, quickly <a href=# title="Mega Evolution">Mega Evolving</a> Lucario. After a few hits from each side, Axel's Tsareena is knocked out, so Ash wins the battle.</p><p>Finally, Ash reaches the last battle of the tournament, where he gets to fight the player. Ash first sends out Dracovish, while the player sends out <a href=# title="Torchic (Pokémon)">Torchic</a>. Ash has Dracovish use <a href=# title="Water Gun (move)">Water Gun</a>. Torchic keeps dodging the attack, but it turns out that Ash wanted to wet the ground with Water Gun in order to freeze it with <a href=# title="Ice Fang (move)">Ice Fang</a>, causing Torchic to lose its footing. Ash then has Dracovish slide on the frozen ground and use <a href=# title="Fishious Rend (move)">Fishious Rend</a> to knock out Torchic. The player then sends out <a href=# title="Solgaleo (Pokémon)">Solgaleo</a> as their next Pokémon, shocking Ash. Ash has Dracovish attack with Fishious Rend, but it is knocked out by Solgaleo. Ash then sends out Sirfetch'd to battle. With the use of <a href=# title="Detect (move)">Detect</a> to dodge and <a href=# title="Fury Cutter (move)">Fury Cutter</a> to attack, Sirfetch'd manages to knock out Solgaleo, while also knocking himself out in the process. Both Ash and the player send out their respective Pikachu as their final Pokémon. Both Pikachu are evenly matched, but Ash uses the <a href=# title="Sync move">sync move</a> Best Buds <a href=# title="10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt (move)">10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt</a> in order to defeat the player, thus making Ash the winner of the tournament.</p><p>The player, Tina, and Lear congratulate Ash on the win. Lear asks Ash if he has forgotten about their promise to battle each other, and Ash says he hasn't. Ash then teams up with Tina and the player for a team battle against Lear, <a href=# title=Rachel>Rachel</a>, and <a href=# title="Sawyer (Masters)">Sawyer</a>.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Pikachu>Pikachu</span></h2><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Availability>Availability</span></h3><p>Ash is exclusive to Master Fair scouts.
