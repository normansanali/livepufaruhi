In a recent interview with <a href=#>The Associated Press</a>, <a href=#><strong>Gisele Bundchen</strong></a> opens up about how she handles NFL playoff time with her New England Patriots quarterback husband, <a href=#><strong>Tom Brady</strong></a>, and juggles modeling and brand-managing while taking care of her children.</p><p>"He's very focused. We are both very supportive of one another in what we do," Bundchen, 33, says of her nearly five-year marriage to Brady, 36. "Of course nobody likes to lose. Those aren't the best days. He knows he does his best. He works extremely hard."</p><p>While Bundchen may support her man, she lacks the same passion he has for football. "At night if my husband is watching TV and watching football, I have my little book and I put something in my ears so I don't hear it and I put my light [on] and have my book and I'm like, 'Ohhh.' He's feeding his soul and that's important to him to watch football," she explained. "I only want to watch if I'm watching him." (Bundchen has angered footballs fans in the past with comments blaming Brady's teammates for their 2012 Super Bowl loss, and being <a href=#>photographed looking sad</a> outside the Patriots' locker room.)</p><p>The same attitude applies to her own work. Bundchen — considered one of the most beautiful and beautifully tressed women in the world — told The Associated Press that she doesn't even own a hairbush, and only has her hair brushed when she has to for a photo shoot.</p><p>"In my job you have to remember people are brushing my hair every day," she said. "You have to remember the last thing I want [on a day off] is a brush in my hair!"</p><p>The Brazilian catwalker is mom to son Ben, 4, and daughter Vivian, 13 months. (Brady is also dad to 6-year-old son John, with ex <strong>Bridget Moynahan</strong>.) Bundchen said that her healthy eating habits have been passed down to her children.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Products are amazing but if you are putting things that are unhealthy inside your body it's just masking stuff . . . I haven't drank soda in 10 years," she shared with The Associated Press. "My kids eat what I eat. The first (solid) food my son had was papaya and then avocado."</p><p>Earlier this week, Bundchen's parenting choices, however, were questioned when she was <a href=#>photographed riding an ATV</a> with daughter Vivian and no helmets. Brady's wife was spotted wearing a bikini with Vivian strapped in a carrier on her chest, while driving with one hand in Costa Rica.</p><p>A rep for Bundchen explained to <a href=#>ABC News</a> on Jan. 14: "Gisele was on a private beach driving very, very slowly."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagoaOauaZ5wa6lnZuYmrtusM6eqqesXaTEr3nAZp%2BaoaKXv7a%2Fx2amp6SpYsSiwMKhnKxllqS8ta7ApaNmr5iau27AzqZkm6qRmcZuvMuasKxlYmV%2BdX2UamY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
