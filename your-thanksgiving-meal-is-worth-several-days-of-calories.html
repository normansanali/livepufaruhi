That includes some appetizers, turkey, several side dishes, a glass of sweet tea, a slice of pecan pie and the use of a tablespoon of butter.</p><p>There have also been lower-calorie estimates. Looking at a different assortment of dishes and portion sizes, <a href=#>the New York Times reported in 2012</a> that a Thanksgiving meal contains 2,486 calories. That figure didn’t include any beverages.</p><p>However, the calories in your Turkey Day dinner be much higher than either estimate.</p><p>“It ranges, but on average anywhere from 3,000 to 4,500 calories,” <a href=#>dietitian Tanya Zuckerbrot</a>, MS, RD, told Fox News. That range is just for the Thanksgiving meal and desserts — and doesn’t include cocktails or appetizers, she explained.</p><p>If these amounts seem steep, Zuckerbrot had several options for a lower-calorie Thanksgiving meal. Those include:</p><ul><li>6 ounces of white, skinless turkey (220 calories and 6 grams of fat) instead of 6 ounces of dark meat turkey with skin (374 calories and 12 grams of fat)</li><li>1 cup of mashed cauliflower (60 calories) instead of 1 cup of regular mashed potatoes (237 calories)</li><li>1/2 cup of baked sweet potato (80 calories) over 1 cup sweet potatoes with marshmallows (610 calories)</li></ul><p>When it comes to dessert, she recommended “going topless” and picking a slice of pumpkin pie, which doesn’t have a top crust. A pumpkin pie slice has 316 calories, versus 526 calories in a slice of pecan pie and 436 calories in a double-crust slice of apple pie, according to Zuckerbrot.</p><p>Another one of her hacks? Treat Thanksgiving like a regular dinner.</p><p>“Don’t walk in ravenous. Have your breakfast and have your lunch,” she said. Eating lunch, she said, offsets an inclination to later overeat during the big meal.</p><p>She also recommended people bring a low-calorie appetizer instead of an entree, and to also help out the hostess.</p><p>That way, Zuckerbrot said, you can “keep hands busy and away from the buffet.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnh7kGpmam5frry2voytn5qmm6i0qsLIp55mpZWWuW610mauqKqknXq0sdWeqZqkXZmuur%2BMqJ1mm5GhvLO1xKxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
