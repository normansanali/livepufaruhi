However, it feels too good to be true, almost as if LEGO Fortnite isnâ€™t a permanent addition.</p><p data-injection=true>Fortnite has grown to be much more than its Battle Royale and Save the World modes. Now, it also comprises Fortnite Festival, Rocket Racing, and LEGO Fortnite, a game mode that seems to be the most popular in the ecosystem. However, Fortnite is a live service game where events come and go after a matter of weeks. But LEGO Fortnite is different, and itâ€™s here to stay for a very long time.</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How To Plant Seeds In LEGO Fortnite: All Seed Types</a></p><h2>Is LEGO Fortnite a Permanent Game Mode in Fortnite?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/LEGO-Fortnite-Cow.jpg><p><strong>Yes, LEGO Fortnite is a permanent game mode that wonâ€™t be removed from Fortnite</strong>.

Other upcoming features they say theyâ€™ve heard about include Impulse Grenades and Stink Bombs.
