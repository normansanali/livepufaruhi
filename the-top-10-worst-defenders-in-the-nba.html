While there are many players who excel at guarding their opponents, there are also those who struggle to hold their ground on the defensive end. In this article, we will take a look at the top 10 worst defenders in the NBA. These players have consistently shown weaknesses in their defensive skills, leading to their inclusion on this list.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>1. James Harden</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>While James Harden is undoubtedly a prolific scorer and offensive threat, his defensive capabilities leave much to be desired. Harden often appears disinterested on defense, frequently getting caught out of position and struggling to stay in front of his man. His lack of effort and focus on the defensive end has earned him a reputation as one of the worst defenders in the league.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>2. Isaiah Thomas</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Isaiah Thomas may be known for his offensive prowess, but his defensive abilities are far from impressive. Standing at just 5'9", Thomas often finds himself overmatched against taller opponents. He struggles to contest shots and frequently gets exploited in pick-and-roll situations. These defensive shortcomings have made him a target for opposing teams.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>3. Enes Kanter</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Enes Kanter's defensive deficiencies have been well-documented throughout his NBA career. Despite his size and strength, Kanter often struggles with defensive rotations and positioning. He is often exploited by opposing teams in the pick-and-roll, and his lack of rim protection is a glaring weakness. Kanter's limitations on defense have limited his playing time and overall impact on the court.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>4. Trae Young</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Trae Young is an electrifying offensive player, but his defensive skills are a major liability. Young's lack of size and strength make it difficult for him to defend against bigger and more physical opponents. He often gets caught reaching for steals, leaving his team vulnerable on the defensive end. Young's defensive struggles have been a major concern for the Atlanta Hawks.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>5. C.J. McCollum</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>C.J. McCollum is known for his scoring ability, but his defensive shortcomings cannot be ignored. McCollum often struggles to stay in front of his man and frequently gets beaten off the dribble. His lack of size and athleticism make it difficult for him to contest shots and provide effective help defense. McCollum's defensive deficiencies have been a consistent issue throughout his career.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>6. D'Angelo Russell</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>D'Angelo Russell has shown flashes of offensive brilliance, but his defensive skills are a major weakness. Russell often lacks focus and effort on the defensive end, leading to lapses in concentration and poor rotations. He struggles to stay in front of his man and frequently gets exploited by opposing guards. Russell's defensive liabilities have hindered his overall impact on the court.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>7. Nikola Jokic</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Nikola Jokic is a phenomenal offensive player and an exceptional playmaker, but his defensive abilities are a major concern. Despite his size, Jokic often struggles with lateral quickness and has difficulty defending in space. He frequently gets beaten off the dribble and struggles with pick-and-roll defense. Jokic's defensive limitations have been a weakness that opposing teams exploit.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>8. Lou Williams</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Lou Williams is renowned for his scoring ability and clutch performances, but his defensive skills are a major liability. Williams lacks the size and strength to defend larger opponents effectively. He often gets caught out of position and struggles to provide meaningful help defense. Williams' defensive limitations have made him a target for opposing offenses.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>9. J.J. Redick</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>J.J. Redick is a deadly shooter from beyond the arc, but his defensive abilities are a significant weakness. Redick often struggles to stay in front of his man and frequently gets exploited by quicker and more athletic opponents. His lack of size and lateral quickness make it difficult for him to contest shots effectively. Redick's defensive limitations have been a consistent weakness throughout his career.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>10. Damian Lillard</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Damian Lillard is an exceptional offensive player, but his defensive skills leave much to be desired. Lillard often struggles to stay in front of his man and frequently gets beaten off the dribble. His lack of size and strength make it difficult for him to defend against bigger opponents. Lillard's defensive limitations have been a concern for the Portland Trail Blazers.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>While these players may excel in various offensive aspects of the game, their defensive deficiencies make them some of the worst defenders in the NBA. Their struggles on the defensive end have been consistently exploited by opposing teams, limiting their overall impact on the court.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6tn55lpKS9bn2PZq6oqqOpeqWxxZ6lnZ2iqHqquoytn55lnpeu</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
