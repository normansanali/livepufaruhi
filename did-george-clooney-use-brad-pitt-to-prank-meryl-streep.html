After all, this modern-day Cary Grant is the epitome of a superstar. The second thing that you might think of is the fact that he's devilishly handsome.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's undeniable.</p><p>But what's also undeniable is the fact that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> George Clooney is a master prankster </a>responsible for some of the most thought-out and often fiendish gags of all time. And his main targets are his fellow celebrities.</p><p>George has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pranked Will & Grace's Leslie Jordan</a>, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, and his former roommate, Serious Man and Curb Your Enthusiasm comedian, Richard Kind. Or, more accurately, he pranked Richard's cat.</p><p>But George loves pranking his best-buddy and Oceans 11, 12, and 13 co-star, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/George-Clooney-and-Brad-pitt-in-Oceans-11.jpg><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Of Brad Pitt’s Best Films (And 5 He Should’ve Passed On)</a></span></p><p>This is probably because Brad can not only take a good prank, but he can totally dish them back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-the-george-v-s-brad-thing-started>How The George V.S. Brad Thing Started</h2><p>George Clooney shared this story <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">while appearing on The Graham Norton Show</a> in England. He was joined by his Tomorrowland co-stars Hugh Laurie and Brit Robertson, who both came out of working with George unscathed.</p><p>It's clear that George is very selective about his targets.</p><p>Most famously, he likes doing "terrible things" to Brad Pitt. Although, George claimed to Graham Norton that Brad has also done some "terrible things" to him. But, in all fairness, George started it...</p><p>According to Popsugar, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">George secretly put a bumper sticker</a> on the back of Brad's car while the two were filming 2001's Ocean's 11. Without knowing, Brad was driving around with a sticker in the shape of "the devil's lettuce" with the caption, "f*** cops".</p><p>George's hope was that the sticker would get Brad pulled over and yelled at... and it did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/George-Clooney-on-pranking-Meryl-Streep-with-brad-pitt.jpg><p>This is what started the war.</p><p>A war that has escalated to the point where Meryl Streep has been deemed a civilian casualty.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/George-Clooney-and-Meryl-Streep-friendhsip-prank.jpg><h2 id=the-brad-pitt-stationery-prank>The Brad Pitt Stationery Prank</h2><p>For the prank that involved Meryl Streep,&nbsp;George used some "Brad Pitt" stationery that he had made up.</p><p>Over the years, George had been writing letters in Brad's name and sending them to various celebrities. Of course, neither Brad nor the other celebrities knew that they were being played by a pranking mastermind.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Close Brad Pitt And Ed Norton Got While Filming ‘Fight Club’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Brad, George sent Meryl an absurdly massive stack of CDs with various dialect coaching classes.&nbsp; We're talking Gaelic, Yiddish, basically every dialect one could imagine.</p><p>The point was to create the illusion that Brad was trying to give Meryl Streep acting advice. He even attached a note "from Brad" that said that the dialect teacher really helped him for his role in Troy so it should help her upcoming work in The Iron Lady.</p><h2 id=epic-pranking-is-all-about-the-long-term-win>Epic Pranking Is All About The Long-Term Win</h2><p>George doesn't prank for the immediate win. He likes the slow, subtle agony. The type of prank that has a pay-off down the line.</p><p>It actually took multiple years for George to reveal&nbsp;that Brad hadn't been so arrogant to send the multiple Academy Award-winning actor acting advice. Therefore, both Brad and Meryl were under the assumption that this had actually happened.</p><p>It would've been awkward at award shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Meryl-Streep-and-Brad-pitt-awkward-at-award-show-.jpg><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Facts About The Cars And Bikes In George Clooney’s Life</a></span></p><p>And there's no doubt that some of these kinds of pranks could get George in some serious trouble.&nbsp;Before Amal Alamuddin, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">George was connected to a lot of beautiful women</a>. But now he has a barrister in his house to help him get out of any potential legal trouble his pranks could get him in...
