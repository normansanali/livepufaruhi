Speaking on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard,"</a> the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Bad Habits" singer</a> confessed that "it would have been a disaster" (agreeing with Shephard's take) if they dated in high school. The pair lost touch in 2013 when Sheeran went on tour, and Seaborn departed for Duke University in America. Sheeran revealed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;they reunited in 2015 in New York City, "where [Seaborn] was living at the time."</p><p>After the school friends connected again, their friendship turned into a full-fledged romance thanks to ... Taylor Swift. In 2017 Sheeran told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, "I went to Taylor's 4th of July party. I was texting [Seaborn], and she was like, 'I'm in Rhode Island at a 4th of July party,' and I was like, 'So am I.'" Sheeran then asked Swift, "'Can I invite one of my old schoolmates?' ... The rest is history."</p><p>Tay's party sparked Sheeran and Seaborn's romance, which led to a walk down the aisle in January 2019. A source close to the singer told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a> about the low-key wedding. "There were only 40 people â€“ so no Taylor Swift, record company executives or any royals or pop star pals ... just a tiny winter wedding," the source explained. After they got married, more changes were in store for Seaborn and Sheeran.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcW5jaoFye9ahpmaho2KypXnSoZyeqpGjwG7DyJ%2BcZpuYmr%2BzxYysnJqan6e7cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
