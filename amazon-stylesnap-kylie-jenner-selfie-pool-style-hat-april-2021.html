You grab your cutest bathing suit, obviously, along with a cover-up for when you’re not in the water. You definitely need a pair of <a href=# data-link=1>sandals</a> or flip flops, your fave sunglasses, a big towel, a water bottle and obviously some heavy-duty sunscreen. All set, right?</p><p>For Us, there’s one more thing that’s always on the list, and that’s a <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">straw sun hat</a>. It’s a must for multiple reasons, from sun protection to style points. We’re not the only ones, of course. Even <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong> wears them for her very own “pool days”!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">RIONA Summer Handwoven Foldable Wide Brim Fisherman 100% Raffia Straw Sun Hat</a> for just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$28 </a>at Amazon!

Hers was a $50 <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Jax Bucket Hat from Frankies Bikinis</a>, but $50 was a little more than we wanted to spend to replicate the look. That’s why we took to Amazon and found an ultra-similar one for under $30!</p><p><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">This bucket hat</a> is made of handwoven raffia straw for a summery look and feel. It’s more than just that though. It also claims to block over 97.5% of UV rays to keep your skin and eyes protected, leaving you cool and relaxed while sunbathing. It gets better from there too, since it also has an adjustable band on the inside so you can tighten or loosen it for the perfect fit!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amazon-straw-hat.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">RIONA Summer Handwoven Foldable Wide Brim Fisherman 100% Raffia Straw Sun Hat</a> for just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$28 </a>at Amazon!
