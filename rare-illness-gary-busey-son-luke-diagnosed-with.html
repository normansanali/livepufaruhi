At the time, Gary Busey's publicist confirmed Luke was "receiving medical attention," however, the couple downplayed their son's medical issues to the media. Six years after Luke was born, the "Point Break" star opened up about the <a href=#>serious and rare health condition</a> his son faced on an episode of "David Tutera's CELEBrations," per <a href=#>People</a>. Specifically, Gary revealed that Luke was diagnosed with Kawasaki disease. According to the <a href=#>Mayo Clinic</a>, the disease "causes swelling (inflammation) in children in the walls of small to medium-sized blood vessels that carry blood throughout the body."</p><p>When Gary discovered his son was in the hospital, he rushed home, abandoning the taping of "Celebrity Apprentice." He shared on "David Tutera's CELEBrations" (via People), "I flew in from the show and Jimmy Kimmel sent me a limo to get me from the airport and took me to Cedars-Sinai, where Steffanie, my wife, spent 13 days and nights in the hospital with little Luke." Luke suffered from various symptoms, including a fever, rash, and increasing heart rate. Fortunately, the young child recovered and is living a happy and healthy life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtoZYZ6fI6rmKudXZ65rbrErKpmn5Gnxm6u1KycsmWjpLtuuNSknGacmZa0r7vSnptmr5mptXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
