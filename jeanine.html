I‚Äôm popping in today to share these super fun, super healthy Kimchi Brown Rice Bliss Bowls. They‚Äôre a delicious mix of crunchy fresh veggies, creamy avocado, spicy kimchi, tangy peanut sauce, and brown rice, with savory marinated grilled tempeh steaks on top. If you‚Äôre someone who wants to eat more plant-based recipes in the New Year, you have to try this one! Hearty, satisfying, and fun to eat, it‚Äôd be a great make-ahead lunch or easy dinner. I posted this recipe on Instagram a while back, and I‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I love days when I have a big container of cooked brown rice in the fridge. It‚Äôs a fantastic starting point for curries, stir fries, fried rice, and more, and its earthy, nutty flavor is even delicious on its own. Sometimes, I‚Äôll toss it with a pinch of salt, top it with an egg, and call it breakfast. Plus, it‚Äôs not only tasty; it‚Äôs good for you too! Brown rice is filled with fiber and other nutrients. When I have it on hand, tossing together a grain bowl for lunch or dinner takes minutes, so I‚Äôm less likely to reach‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Have you tried tempeh? If you follow a plant-based diet or are interested in eating less meat, it‚Äôs a fantastic source of protein. Unlike tofu, it has a meaty, firm texture and yummy nutty flavor. As a result, it‚Äôs incredibly versatile ‚Äì I love layering into sandwiches, crumbling it up to mimic ground meat, tossing into stir fries, and searing it like a steak. Read on to find my go-to method for how to cook it, along with my best tempeh recipes. However you try it, I hope you love it too! What is Tempeh?

I love it in just about anything ‚Äì broccoli salad, frittatas, pasta, etc. ‚Äì but my favorite way to eat broccoli might be the simplest: roasted! Roasted broccoli is so easy to make, and the florets come out of the oven deliciously golden brown, crisp, and tender. I have a hard time not eating them all straight off the sheet pan, but they‚Äôre also a fantastic addition to all sorts of recipes and a yummy side dish on their own.

Creamy, spicy, savory, and a little sweet, it‚Äôs a sauce that I‚Äôm equally happy drizzling over dinner or enjoying straight off a spoon. I can‚Äôt get enough! This peanut sauce recipe the first thing I turn to whenever I want to jazz up a simple stir fry, bowl, or salad at home. It‚Äôs super easy to make, and it calls for basic pantry ingredients that you likely already have on hand (no fish sauce here!).

I love stuffing rice paper wrappers with lots of fresh produce, mixing together a flavorful dipping sauce, and digging in! In this recipe, I toss noodles with an easy, sweet and savory peanut sauce made of peanut butter, sriracha, tamari, and a drop of maple syrup. Then, I roll the noodles into wrappers with avocado, saut√©ed mushrooms, green onion, and fresh basil and mint.

But as someone who still eats it for breakfast or lunch a few times a week, I have to say that I think avocado toast is here to stay! It‚Äôs super easy to make, it‚Äôs healthy and satisfying, and it‚Äôs a blank canvas for flavorful seasonal toppings. What‚Äôs not to love?

Of course, there are exceptions, but the food I most enjoy cooking and eating often happens to be plant-based. I love putting vegetables at the center my plate ‚Äì not only is it good for my health and for the world, but it‚Äôs also downright delicious. To kick off the New Year, I‚Äôve rounded up my top 85 easy vegan recipes.

It‚Äôs seems like it‚Äôs everywhere and in everything, so I thought I would take a few minutes to ‚Äúdive deep‚Äù on this phenomenon, especially because I keep using it, and now I can just link to this post in future recipes üôÇ So what is it? It‚Äôs simply cauliflower pulsed in a food processor until it forms into granules that are about the size of rice. Is it as good as rice? Not on its own, but it‚Äôs a great starting point health-wise and texture-wise.

It‚Äôs just the thing for cold nights, days when you‚Äôre craving a healthy reset, or any time you‚Äôre feeling a bit under the weather. I first started making it years ago, when I was bouncing back from a cold and had a ton of random veggies in the fridge. Using the ingredients I had in my pantry‚Äîvegetable broth, diced tomatoes, dried herbs, and vinegar‚ÄîI transformed this jumble of vegetables into an amazing soup! Since then, I‚Äôve made it again and again, with a different mix of veggies every time.

To me, it seems like it was just yesterday that we were at the farmers market buying veggies to turn into pasta salad and zucchini bread. This year may have raced past us, but we certainly had good moments along the way. In particular, we released our second cookbook. I can‚Äôt tell you how much we love seeing readers try recipes from it and from the blog! Before we take on 2020, I wanted to share a few top recipes from the last year.
