The Enigmatic Soul thinks he has finally found an ideal place to write the last chapter of his career along with his brother, Matt.</p><p>In a recent interview with the Ad-Free Supershow Media Scrum, Jeff Hardy discussed retirement and how the age of him and his brother and AEW being an ideal spot for them makes it a suitable place for them to turn it into their last run.</p><p>“Our last run,” Hardy said. “We’re getting older, you know? I’m 44, Matt’s 45, 46, 47. So I mean, it’s our last run. It’s gonna be special and I think AEW is the place we can actually do that open-minded. Like, it’s free. So it feels so good. I’m right exactly where I’m supposed to be.”</p><p>Jeff Hardy also opened up in the ensuing discussion on his signature move Swanton Bomb being a painful experience for both him and his opponent. Hardy confirmed that it indeed was the case.</p><p>“Yeah, it hurts. It hurts,” Hardy said. “It hurts the guy. It’s no longer the Swanton Bomb, it’s the Crouton Bomb. The other night with Marc Quen, I just crushed him. It was terrible. It used to be, but actually we had an indie show with nZo and Cass and I really took care of him, man. So I rolled right off him. It’s one of those things, man. As you get older, you kind of like, lose control on certain things.”</p><p>Recently, AEW Star Isiah Kassidy sent a message calling out Jeff Hardy for being an unsafe worker and urged him to bid goodbye to the business. He explained how Jeff’s botched Swanton Bomb could have ended up breaking his ribs.</p><p>While it is true that age takes a lot out of a man’s instincts, the day the Charismatic Enigma hangs his wrestling boots will be a sad day for the wrestling world.</p><span class=author-name>Bhupen Dange</span> <span></span><p>Bhupen is a freelance writer for Ringside News and Thirsty For News; he is pursuing further studies in Computer Science.
