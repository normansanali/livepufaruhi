The constant harassment challenged going to school, and he struggled with his self-esteem and confidence.</p><p>However, things improved when Tomas turned 17 and decided to start going to the gym. He spent the entire summer of 2018 training and educating himself about nutrition and workout.</p><p>He worked hard to progress, eating four meals daily and sticking to an essential rice, chicken, and egg diet. As he trained from Monday to Saturday, he noticed a significant change not only in his physique but also in his mindset.</p><p>After spending the summer training from Monday to Saturday, it was time to return to school.

The teasing stopped, the bullies disappeared, and those who laughed before asked for advice.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Tomas Holder with Pauli Balbi" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tomas-Holder-with-Pauli-Balbi.jpg alt="Tomas Holder with Pauli Balbi" width=400 height=448 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Who is Tomas Holder’s Girlfriend?</strong></h2><p>Tomas was previously in a relationship with Pauli Balbi.
