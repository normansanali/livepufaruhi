Not only did she feel like the odd stew out with Kate Chastain and Josiah Carter, but she suffered from a lingering foot illness that left it swollen for days. Bedol went to the doctor who told her she had an infection from a Tahitian mosquito and was given antibiotics but it didn't get any better. As Bedol limped back from another doctor's visit, she caught Chastain telling Carter, "I don't think she's lying. It was obviously swollen (via <a href=#>People</a>). Bedol mistook what the chief stew said and replied, "I'm not lying. I'm so upset that you would think that I was lying." Chastain and Carter ended up having to pick up Bedol's slack for a few charters and when the third stew was ready to get back on her feet, she wasn't ready for the work overload.</p><p dir=ltr>Midseason, Bedol made the shocking announcement to the crew that she was leaving the boat. "It was a huge surprise. Like, not only am I gonna leave you midseason, put you in a tough place, I'm gonna make sure on my way out, I'm gonna do everything I can to give you a more difficult time when I'm gone by making the crew think you were a bad person," Chastain told Bravo's <a href=#>The Daily Dish.</a>&nbsp;Bedol later shared with fans that the reason for her mysterious foot injury was neuropathy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxoaYB0hI6bnKWnp2Kxpq%2FKZqqtmaKoeq2xxa1krKCfrHqlwcRmn56ZnKm1brzRqJmlnZ2ofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
