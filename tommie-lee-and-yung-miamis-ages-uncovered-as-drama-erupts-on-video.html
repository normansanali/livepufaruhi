Tommie does most of the talking, and accuses Yung Miami of writing some “weird a** s*** on the blog.”</p><p>Yung Miami and her friends are heard telling Tommie “it was funny.” Tommie responds to that with: “I’m never going to touch this b****.” She is then seen telling someone trying to hold her back to: “Get off.”</p><p>Twitter users claim Tommie is upset with Yung Miami because she wrote a comment about her on a blog. The drama comes less than a year after Tommie had a fight with Akbar V after saying she had “no endorsements.”</p><p>Most have come to the conclusion Tommie was “pressing” Yung Miami, but others are convinced LAHH star Santana was the person the feud was directed at.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-revealed-tommie-s-age-and-birthday>Revealed: Tommie’s age and birthday</h2><p>Tommie is 38 years old at the time of writing.

The musician, real name Caresha Romeka Brownlee, was born in Florida and is in a girl group with 29-year-old JT (Jatavia Shakara Johnson).</p><p>Several fans who watched the video believe the heated discussion with Tommie would have been different if JT was there, as they think she would have stuck up for her best friend Yung Miami.</p><p>Santana was also present at the argument. She is 28 years old. Following the drama, one Twitter user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">reacted</a>: “This woman [Yung Miami] has a whole career and two kids to think about – why would she risk that for Tommie?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/07/GettyImages-1406615022-1024x683.jpg><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a> AND <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FACEBOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xXaOyuL%2BOraampZmaeq2xxGaYp5xdrsKvs4ymoJqlmah6orPErGSuppOkw6a%2BxJ1kmqtdmb%2BiucBmnKutoKnAbrvNZq2inJWk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
