Ricky revealed that his team at the time had warned him to hide his sexuality.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_HKISJrjW data-wc=43>He said they told him: "You don't need to share, everybody knows around you, you don't have to tell the world – your friends know, your family know, why do you need to stand in front of the camera and talk about it?&nbsp;</p><p id=ePSwd0jlf5 data-wc=29>"They didn't understand the importance of it. Now I see it. I understood before they did how important it is, not only for me, but to be a spokesperson."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/da9019be7524-ricky-martin-jwan-yosef-divorce.jpg><p id=eW1dWXrn8o data-wc=43>Ricky is thankful that he went against their advice, adding: "You know, I pressed send and I was like, 'Oh, that's it?' My assistant who's still my assistant, Paco, he was next to me and I'm like, 'I think I need a hug'."&nbsp;</p><p id=e3-22aQNpn data-wc=25>Despite the emotional moment, Ricky stated: "I wish I could come out 20 times.
