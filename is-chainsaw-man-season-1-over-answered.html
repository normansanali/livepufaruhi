He is brought back to life by a zombie devil’s contract, merging with a chainsaw devil to become a hybrid — that way, he maintains his humanity while also gaining special abilities. Those abilities catch the attention of a team of governmental devil hunters, who convince him to work with them.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>Just like the manga was among the highest-selling of 2021, its adaptation was one of the biggest <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">anime series of 2022</a>. But the story is far from over. The first 12 episodes cover roughly 38 of the more than 110 chapters of the manga, which means there is a lot more to come, so you might be wondering how many seasons await.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>Anime seasons can be complicated to understand at times, making it harder to know if a season is really over or not after the usual 12 episodes. Years are split into three-month sections called “cours,” where new and returning anime get new episodes every week, and each cour usually lasts 12 or 13 weeks.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=577 data-injectable=true>A lot of the shorter works don’t even return for a second cour and fit the entire story in that number of episodes. It’s the longer ones we usually worry about, because each season may be split into different cours — and sometimes they’re not even consecutive.</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>With the end of the last cour of 2022, the first season of Chainsaw Man is also over. Back in September, studio MAPPA <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed that season one would be comprised of only 12 episodes</a>, to air from October until December 2022.</p><p data-characters=77 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>So far, no information was revealed about when the second season could start.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6iqmabmJa2r7%2FAsGSmmZ5iwKat0qilZmldpMOmvoyapayvlaeypXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
