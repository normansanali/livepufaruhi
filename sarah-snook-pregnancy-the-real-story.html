Relationship</h2><p>To clear the air, Sarah is not currently pregnant. However, she received some criticism for putting on weight based on her appearance in recent<strong> “Succession”</strong> episodes, which ultimately led people to believe she was expecting.</p><figure id=attachment_1432973 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-1432973 style=width:650px class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding=async src alt="Sarah Snook" width=650 height=550 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sarah and Her Husband, Dave Lawson (Source: Dailymail)</strong></figure><p>In addition, her recent<strong> marriage to comedian Dave Lawson</strong> raised even more skepticism. But in reality, she is not expecting a child and already has one.</p><p>Additionally, the actress’s hardly perceptible weight increase was the basis for the pregnancy rumors, which is a worrying attitude for women and how their bodies are seen.</p><p>When a woman gains weight, the typical response is to assume that she is pregnant right away. This highlights the unjust body standards that are imposed on women, but fear not—Sarah is here to ruthlessly criticize them all.</p><p>Speaking to Vogue Australia, she made a strong declaration about how she is tired of these expectations.</p><p>She asked, “Can I truly be f*cked up adhering to an unattainable beauty standard that then perpetuates and makes other women unhappy because they feel like they can’t achieve something that’s not actually possible anyway?</p><p>Therefore, while having a child may be an option down the road, Snook is not currently considering it. She must instead pay attention to her unexpected and covert marriage.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>According To Evan Roberts, Every Women Is A Hero For Surviving Childbirth</a></p><h2>The Restricted Wedding of Sarah Snook</h2><p>In the middle of the<strong> pandemic’s pandemonium and the lockdown</strong>, Snook discovered love in the shape of her best friend for years. During the lockdown, she wed comedian Dave Lawson in her backyard. In actuality, their love story was sparked by the lockdown. Despite their long friendship, there was no sign of affection between them.</p><p>However, when they were forced to stay together during the epidemic, they got close and discovered that their true love had been waiting for them right in front of them the entire time. She, therefore, considers herself fortunate and claims to have discovered the pandemic’s bright side.</p><p>She remarked,</p><p>“We might not have come together so soon if it weren’t for the epidemic, which is a really nice blessing”.</p><p>They consequently made the decision to remain friends for life. In 2020, Sarah and Dave exchanged vows. For the actress, a velvet Chloe coat and Blundstones worked as wedding wear. She was also the one who asked Dave to marry her after realizing that this was it.</p><p>She stated:</p><p>“That was the only option. It resembled, “I have to go in. I’m here and I’m all in.”</p><p>We were completely unprepared for it, she continued, “but once we fell in love, there was no turning back; we couldn’t be apart.” Snook typically keeps her personal life very quiet, but she felt compelled to talk a little bit about her union with Dave.</p><p>She posted a photo of herself and her husband on Instagram, and in the photo, she is beaming with joy. That’s what I suppose occurs when you marry a comic.</p><p>However, the only thing that matters is that Sarah is content. She hasn’t made any <strong>announcements on her plans to become pregnant</strong>, but she has more to look forward to with her happy marriage and prosperous career.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Chris Colfer, Who Is Openly Gay, Is Dating Someone</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a> <a href=# rel=tag>film actor</a></span> <a href=#><img src alt title="Gina Hiraizumi" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Gina Hiraizumi</a></h3>Gina Hiraizumi estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
