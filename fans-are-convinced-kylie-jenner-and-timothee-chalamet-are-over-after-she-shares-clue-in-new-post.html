But it wasn’t only that Kylie vacationed without Timothee that led some fans to think something was off, but also her seemingly somber expression.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ttweb_everything-we-know-about-kylie-jenner-s-current-net-worth_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Everything We Know About Kylie Jenner's Current Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Kylie is the second richest of the Kardashian-Jenners, quickly catching up to her big sister Kim Kardashian, and will soon reach billionaire status.</span><h2 id=fans-believe-kylie-looked-extra-sad-in-her-recent-post>Fans Believe Kylie Looked Extra Sad In Her Recent Post</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screen-shot-2024-02-20-at-9-13-35-am.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In one image, the mother-of-two posed outdoors at dusk, clad in a form-fitting, sheer tan gown that accentuated her curves. With her dark hair styled in an updo, Kylie sported a serious expression as she gazed skyward with her eyes closed.</p><p>As The Sun notes, some of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie’s followers questioned if something was wrong</a> in the comments, even directly mentioning Timothee and questioning if their relationship was okay.</p><p>"She looks depressed," one person wrote, while another said, "My initial thought was that these photos have an energy about them as well.

Timothée appeared subdued during promotion for Dune: Part 2, earlier in the week, or at least that’s what fans think so.</p><p>Photographs from the event captured the actor alongside his co-star Zendaya, 27, on the red carpet in Seoul, South Korea. <a href=#>Both donned matching leather jumpsuits</a>, with Zendaya in pink and Timothée in gray, accentuated by a waist belt. Fans couldn't help but interpret Timothée's demeanor (and outfit choice) as reflective of a potential split from Kylie, further fueling speculation about the couple's relationship status. At the very least, there were questions over whether Kylie was alright with Timothee rocking a amtching look with his co-star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Zendaya and Tim Tam promoting Dune in Seoul, South Korea, wearing matching outfits. Is Kylie seething? Where is her matching outfit with her man?" one person wrote in a Reddit thread, while another chimed in,"Timothée looks kinda tired and fed up lmao."</p><p>Allegations of relationship problems between Timothee and Kylie have been circulating for weeks. They intensified over Valentine’s when it seemed like the couple spent the romantic holiday apart, though it would’ve been their first time celebrating. Kylie showed off the gifts she got for her two kids, whom she shares with her ex Travis Scott, but some fans speculated why Kylie hadn’t gotten anything for Timothee.</p><p>There have also been reports that not only is Timothee <a href=#>growing tired of Kylie’s luxurious lifestyle</a>, but she’s also imposing strict rules on him. One report claimed <a href=#>Kylie insists on knowing Timothee’s passwords</a> and is apparently suspicious of his exes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For now, Kylie and Timothee are refusing to directly comment on the speculation about what’s going on between them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYq6zsYycpqeumaOwprCMpLCloZVit6a6zZ6pZpmemXq1tcyoq6GdlWKwqa3LmqSerF2Wv6Z5zq%2Bcq2WRm8Gmvoysn55lo52us7HSZpqlrZVitq95zZ6uZqifqMFw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
