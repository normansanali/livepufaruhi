Rapper Nicki Minaj hosted the show, which saw <a href=#>Bebe Rexha</a>, Taylor Swift, and Drake nominated for their efforts this year. However, Bebe almost skipped out on the ceremony after becoming frustrated with the dress she planned to wear to the show.</p><p>The “I’m Good (Blue)” singer suggested that she may appear on the red carpet but wasn't sure. Despite her previous hesitation, Bebe attended the star-studded event and her gown was the talk of the town. Here’s an explanation of the controversy surrounding Bebe’s VMA dress.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bebe Rexha’s VMA dress has sparked some controversy!</h2><p>Bebe ultimately decided to walk the pink carpet at the VMAs and did so proudly. The Grammy-nominated singer donned a form-fitting black dress, equipped with skin-barring cutouts on her butt. The gown also featured a cone-shaped bustier and a black horse tail. As she walked the pink carpet, Bebe flashed a dazzling smile for photographers, having seemingly overcome her previous frustrations. However, Bebe’s dress has caused some controversy and fans are dragging her online.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>“These cutouts on Bebe Rexha's dress are random and ugly,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one person wrote</a>. While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another</a> suggested that the singer’s dress choice was questionable as there were minors at the event. Fans even captured <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">screenshots</a> of Shakira’s brother reacting to Bebe’s dress, and he appeared startled by the sight. Bebe hasn't responded to the backlash, but she did share an image of herself from the pink carpet on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Shakira’s brother reaction to Bebe Rexha’s cut out dress <a href=#>#VMAs</a> <a href=#>#VMAs2023</a> <a href=#>#beberexha</a> <a href=#>#shakira</a> <a href=#>#MTVAwards</a> <a href=#>#MTVVMAs</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/K9xZEKK7Gf</a></p>— GrindModeJoe (@GrindModeJoe20) <a href=#>September 13, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bebe Rexha almost didn't attend the VMAs for multiple reasons.</h2><p>Days before the VMAs, Bebe took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> and explained that she was feeling “anxious AF.” Partially due to her dress and her weight.</p><p>“The VMAs are tomorrow, and I am anxious AF,” Bebe said in the clip. Adding, “I don’t know if I am going tomorrow… I do have an outfit. It is cute. And I do want to wear my dress.” She emphasized that she was “very grateful” to receive a VMA nomination for her collaboration with David Guetta but revealed that she was overcome with anxiety. Bebe explained that she was tired of being ridiculed for her weight.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bebe Rexha has had a tough year.</h2><p>The dress debacle at the VMAs isn't the first controversy for Bebe in 2023. In July, the “I’m A Mess” songstress shared screenshots of text messages from her ex-boyfriend, Keyan Safyari, which showed the two in a messy argument. In the messages, Keyan explained that he loved Bebe before suggesting that she gained weight. “Would you rather I lied to you? You gained 35 pounds obviously you gained weight and your face changes,” he said in the text (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>).</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Opinions about the exchange were divided. The View’s Sonny Hostin came to Keyan’s defense, suggesting that the messages were delivered lovingly. “It was worded very nicely… And then she posts it and makes him out to be a jerk,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sonny said</a>. However, Joy Behar disagreed. Adding, “It's a big mistake to say ‘You look fat.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7KjsYyrnLGgkWKxs7HSrGScp56pv7DCxKuqsg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
