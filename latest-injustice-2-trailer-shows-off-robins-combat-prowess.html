The gameplay trailer, which you can see above, was shown yesterday as part of a livestream by Ed Boon and NetherRealm, which provides a detailed run-through of all the fighter’s abilities.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=492 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>Now, we’re not sure which version of Robin this is supposed to be, but considering the dialogue between himself and Batman before they duke it out, it looks like the man wearing the mask this time around is Damian Wayne, Bruce and Talia al Ghul’s son. Robin makes direct reference to the Caped Crusader being his father, but who knows if he means it literally or figuratively. One thing’s for sure, it’s not Dick Grayson – Batman’s retort confirms as much.</p>[zergpaid]<p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>Regardless, whoever it is in the costume, this iteration of Robin looks incredible, at least from what was seen in the trailer. Predictably agile, fast and a dab hand at using gadgets, Robin not only has a sword at his disposal to fight off combatants but can teleport behind opponents through the use of a projectile in order to evade enemy moves.</p><p data-characters=568 data-current-count=916 data-injectable=true>So, that’s another iconic DC figure confirmed for Injustice 2, but what about the possibility of some <a href=#>more obscure characters</a>? According to comments made by Boon during the livestream, such things will most definitely be included in the beat ’em up’s final line-up, so don’t worry – your favorite hero or villain could still be in with a chance to appear. As an aside, Boon also confirms that invites to the game’s beta are now in the process of being sent out, so you’ll want to keep checking your email at regular intervals.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false><strong>Injustice 2</strong> is out for <a href=#>Xbox One </a>and <a href=#>PlayStation 4</a> in May. Sadly, with the issues that Warner Bros. have <a href=#>faced in the past with porting titles to PC</a>, it looks like this particular title is skipping out on the platform indefinitely, at least for the immediate future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoo5qslajBbrXNo6ysrJmYsm5%2BjK2pmqGcmr9uv8eorqxln5uzbr7Om6Cnq12YvK6uwK1kqaqfrLK0v44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
