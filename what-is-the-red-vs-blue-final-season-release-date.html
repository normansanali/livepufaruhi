One of the most popular web series to come out of the network was <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Red vs. Blue</a></strong>, a machinima sort of set in the Halo universe.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=653 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, Rooster Teeth’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery is set to shut it all down for good according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>. Rooster Teeth had supposedly not been profitable for years, and with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">controversy from a couple years ago tarnishing the company’s reputation</a>, it seems like the right time to put the whole thing to rest. That means no more Red vs. Blue, unfortunately. The show has been one of the most beloved creations to come out of Rooster Teeth, and it’s the second-longest running web series after Homestar Runner. They had an incredibly good run, 21 years and 18 seasons, but the next season will mark the end of the road.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-can-we-expect-red-vs-blue-season-19-to-release data-injectable=false>When can we expect Red vs. Blue season 19 to release?</h2><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>The nineteenth season, titled Red vs. Blue: Restoration, was officially announced back in July last year with the promise it would release sometime in 2024, although there hasn’t been any word on a specific date at the moment. The prologue is available to watch online and has been since last year, but fans have been left completely in the dark regarding the release of new episodes.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>Typically viewers would be able to access episodes early on Rooster Teeth FIRST, a premium membership service for content from the company. With the announcement earlier this week, it’s uncertain where the final season will be released now.</p><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=175 data-injectable=false>Still, fans are looking forward to seeing season 19 when it finally drops, especially considering the fact that Burnie Burns and Matt Hullum are returning to write and direct.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKKrXam1pnnRnptmrqNir63BxGadoqaRoXq0scCspqdlopq5pq3SnmSdmaSafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
