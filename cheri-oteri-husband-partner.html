So, the details of her relationship status are not available to the public as she is not the kind of person who would reveal it. The secretive SNL alum has never opened up about who she's dating or who she's married to, if at all. So, the public doesn't even know if she has a partner who she is just dating or if she has a fiancee, or if she has a husband.</p><p>In her decades-long career, Cheri Oteri has not once opened up about her relationship.

This kind of mystery surrounding her love life has generated a lot of rumors about her marital status, past relationships, her partners, and her sexual orientation as well.</p><p>One such rumor about Cheri Oteri's relationship is that she was once involved with <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong>, who is now husband to <strong>Hilaria Baldwin</strong>. Now that is not a concrete truth because none of the people involved ever came forward and confirmed those speculations. So, take everything about this relationship with her supposed partner Alec Baldwin with a grain of salt.</p><p>So, the rumor of their much-talked-about relationship that people still don't know for sure if it is true or not goes like this; Cheri Oteri met Alec Baldwin through one of the points of their commonality which is Saturday Night Live. She used to be a regular cast till 2000 and Alec too had been a part of the show. They met on the sets of SNL and hit it off and began dating soon.</p><p>The rumor didn't go deeper and there were no questions like could Alec Baldwin be her future husband. But it had quite a buzz then. Though the subjects of the rumor themselves never confirmed their relationship, lots of people believed otherwise. People think that though their dating might not have ended in marriage and Alec never became her husband, but still they were very serious.</p><p>There are many stories about Alec Baldwin and Cheri Oteri being spotted together on various occasions but none of them have been verified. Alec is now happily married to his partner Hilaria Baldwin now.</p><p>Cheri recently had an interaction with her rumored former partner. She voiced her <a href=# rel=noopener>support for him</a> during the investigation on the sets of Alec's upcoming movie Rust which had to be held after he shot a real loaded gun killing one and injuring another in the process.</p><p><strong>I am so sorry Alec. I will pray for all involved. Stay strong and surround yourself with people you love.</strong></p><p>Another rumor is that Cheri Oteri has a non-celebrity husband so, she prefers to keep the spotlight away from him, which is why there is no information about who she's married to or who she's dating.</p><p>Also, Cheri Oteri was believed to be dating a man named <strong>Johnny</strong> in 2020. Apparently, they were very close and were very likely to go from being partners to husband and wife if the rumors are to be believed. That never came to be, it seems like.
