Chisago County Sheriff’s Office deputies arrived on the scene at around noon after receiving a complaint of a disturbance at a residence on Elmcrest Avenue.</p><p>When deputy sheriffs arrived on the scene, they heard gunfire and thought the rounds were originating from within the residence. After being sent with great caution, a SWAT team found a dead body inside the house. The victim, Sarah Carda, worked as a dedicated nurse for the Isanti County Sheriff’s Office.&nbsp;Everyone in the neighborhood is surprised by her unexpected demise.</p><p>Sarah’s department colleagues and friends are finding it difficult to accept her passing. Sheriff Wayne Seiberlich of Isanti County, Minnesota, sent the county’s and the agency’s sincere sympathies. He described it as a “senseless act of domestic violence,” highlighting the gravity of the situation.&nbsp;The terrible passing of Sarah Carda serves as yet another reminder of the harm that domestic abuse can do.</p><p>For many years to come, her expertise and nursing skills will be acknowledged. Everyone in this room wants Sarah’s friends and family to know how much the community is pulling for them at this trying time. While neighbors gather to console one another, we also need to unite to stop tragedies like this one from happening again.</p><p>We must move quickly to put a stop to domestic abuse and protect those who are at risk in Sarah’s memory.The family of Sarah has requested that donations be made in place of flowers. This gesture will enable the significant work she started to continue and serve as a suitable remembrance of her. May Sarah Carda find eternal rest through prayer. She will always be remembered with affection by all who knew and loved her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZbDprrLsmSmnZ2kv6qty6xlnKedZMCivsChZJyZopmubrDEmquhZZmorq%2FAyGakp2WdlrturdGrnKyslZl6orLTnqlmnJWWsa3FjKyfqKeknruoecCtZJ%2Bho516ra3KnmStp6ejwKm1z2ZpaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
