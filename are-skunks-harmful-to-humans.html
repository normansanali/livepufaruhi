Sulfur has that classic rotten egg smell, and it’s what gives thiol its <b>gag-inducing power</b>. For detection purposes, thiols are added to otherwise smell-free natural gas, so that it will have a noticeable odor.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-do-skunks-spray-every-night></span>Why do skunks spray every night?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Since skunks are nocturnal and awake during the night, they are MUCH more likely to spray at night. A recent study from Evolution (link to research) indicated that animals who spray as a defense mechanism are likely to spray at night <b>due to a higher risk of coming in contact with close range predators</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-neutralizes-skunk-smell></span>What neutralizes skunk smell?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Chemist Paul Krebaum discovered a solution that changes the odorous thiols into odorless acids, thereby chemically neutralizing the skunk odor. The formula is: <b>1 quart of 3 percent hydrogen peroxide</b> (fresh bottle), • ¼ cup of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and • 1-2 teaspoons of liquid dish soap.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-deskunk-a-human></span>How do you Deskunk a human?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Just take the entire bottle of hydrogen peroxide and pour it in the bowl. Then add a fourth of a cup of baking soda (or vinegar) and <b>about a teaspoon of the dish soap</b>. Mix them together with your hands. (Does it really matter if they smell like peroxide at this point?)<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=will-a-skunk-chase-you></span>Will a skunk chase you?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>What is this? If you do happen to come across skunks that have made themselves comfortable in your home, you can rest assured that <b>they will not chase you</b>. Most likely, they will run away in the opposite direction out of fear. All skunks want to do is eat and take care of their babies in peace.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-get-a-skunk-to-leave></span>How do you get a skunk to leave?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A bright light or a motion sensor flood light will scare skunks away. Most animals, including skunks, dislike the smell of citrus fruits. <b>Place orange or lemon peels around the yard</b> as a natural skunk repellent. Predator urine (dogs, coyotes) can be used to repel a skunk.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-months-are-skunks-most-active></span>What months are skunks most active?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich — Skunks are most active from <b>February into early March</b>. Although a warm day like the one we had Sunday can get them moving, they’re really on the move because they’re looking for a mate.
