See below for chocolate suggestions.</li><li><strong>Butter</strong> — use unsalted butter to control the amount of salt in this chocolate cake recipe.</li><li><strong>Sugar</strong> — use granulated sugar.</li><li><strong>Vanilla</strong> — use high-quality vanilla extract like <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B000GAWH4G data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow>Nielsen-Massey</a>.</li><li><strong>Eggs</strong> — use large eggs in all baking recipes.</li><li><strong>Cocoa Powder</strong> — I suggest using unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder.</li><li><strong>Salt</strong> — a flavor enhancer in baked goods.</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Flourless-Chocolate-Cake-9-720x521.jpg alt="Rich decadent flourless chocolate cake recipe with chocolate ganache.

You can use semi-sweet chocolate bars, chocolate chips, or chocolate wafers. If you use chocolate chips, I suggest using Ghirardelli, Guittard, Valrhona or Callebaut chocolate.</p><h3>What type of cocoa powder should I use in flourless chocolate cake recipe?</h3><p>Cocoa Powder comes in natural and Dutch versions. Dutching raises the cocoa powder’s pH levels, which neutralizes its acids and rounds out its flavor. Both natural and Dutch cocoa will work in recipes. Dutch-processed cocoa will produce baked goods with a darker color and moister texture.</p><p data-slot-rendered-content=true>My favorite cocoa powder to use is Dutch-process cocoa powder. I love to use Callebaut Dutched Cocoa Powder. It has a warmer color with reddish-brown notes. It is slightly sweeter than the dark dutch cocoa powder. I find this unsweetened cocoa powder in the bulk section at Winco. It is much less expensive at Winco than you can find online.</p><p data-slot-rendered-content=true><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Flourless-Chocolate-Cake-14-720x624.jpg alt="Rich decadent flourless chocolate cake recipe with chocolate ganache.
