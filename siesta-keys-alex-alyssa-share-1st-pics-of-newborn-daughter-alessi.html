I am so incredibly in love with you my beautiful Alessi. Thank you for changing our lives forever. To everyone who has reached out, THANK YOU. I didn’t have my phone the entire time in the hospital because I just couldn’t get enough of our sweet blessing.”</p><p>Kompothecras, also 25, also shared photos from the delivery room via social media. “The most incredible moment of my life is when I met you Alessi,” the<a href=#> Siesta Key </a>star wrote on Sunday. “XOXO.”</p><p>His girlfriend commented, “Our beautiful baby girl! Best day of our life forever and always. Love you both so so much.”</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in December 2019 that the couple were<a href=#> expecting their first child</a>. The MTV personality revealed the baby-to-be’s sex when he posted a photo of himself kissing Salerno’s baby bump, captioned, “Little princess on the way.”</p><p>That same month, Kompothecras’ ex<strong> Juliette Porter</strong> told Entertainment Tonight that she thinks <a href=#>he’ll be “a great father.”</a> The Florida native, 22, said at the time: “I think this girl will be good for him. She’s a lot more into his lifestyle than I am. … She’s definitely calmer than I am in ways, and I think she accepts more things than I do. I wish him the best. This is his path now and I hope things work out for him.”</p><p>As for Salerno, she shared her reaction to their baby news three moths later. “I was definitely in shock, totally freaked out,” the hair salon owner said in a March YouTube video. “Looking at the test, it’s real s–t. You kind of sit there and think of everything at once, and it scares you.”</p><p>The then-pregnant star went on to share her No. 1 craving — Lucky Charms. “When I tell you, I have never in my life liked Lucky Charms,” the Meraki Wild owner said. “I always liked Captain Crunch or Froot Loops.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Us confirmed on Friday, June 12, that the pair had become parents. The new dad’s mom, <strong>Beth Kompothecras</strong>, wrote via Instagram earlier this week: “Our Hearts are full of love as Gary and I welcome our First Grandchild. She is beautiful. There are no words. <span class="markyijgv741t SSBqA0O5vTLfa9GC1wxGQ" data-markjs=true>Congratulations</span> Alyssa and Alex you are going to be amazing parents!
