Of course, there was a lot riding on the success of this album. Upon release, it had been five years since CTRL had hit the market. This album was considered to be one of the best of 2017, which is impressive when you consider how great that year was. Although some felt like she couldn't follow up on this success, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">she proved everyone wrong</a>. Subsequently, she has put herself in the running as one of the biggest artists in the world.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Additionally, there has been all sorts of discourse surrounding SZA and her butt. The artist is one of many who have gotten themselves a BBL. Brazilian Butt Lifts are quite controversial, however, they are immensely popular in entertainment circles. For the R&B songstress, it's just about accentuating her features. “I hate trying on clothes,” SZA told Elle. “I don’t shop anywhere, I just wear whatever is free in my mail. I’m like, ‘Is it an extra large? Great.’ If I can feel like I’m under a blanket when I’m outside, that’s ideal. I treat my butt like a purse. It’s just there to enhance whatever else. And that’s why I paid for it, because it works all by itself.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-sza-reveals-what-she-s-been-up-to>SZA Reveals What She's Been Up To</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Since getting this BBL, SZA has certainly obtained some newfound confidence. We know this because <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">she frequently posts her curves on social media.</a> In her latest Instagram post, the "Kill Bill" singer revealed some sexy shots of herself in a mirror. Moreover, she showcased a picture of her butt in a bikini as she lays on a pier. She also showcased what she is reading right now.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Overall, fans are excited to see what might be next for SZA. After all, she is an artist who has proven that she can do it all. Moreover, with two amazing albums under her belt, one can just imagine what that third project would sound like.
