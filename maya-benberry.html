She’s a big deal on platforms like Instagram and Twitter, where she has a massive following. You can also find Maya on TikTok, where she shares short and snappy video clips.</p><p>Maya burst onto the scene back in 2016 when she made a splash on a dating show called “Catching Kelce,” which aired on E! Entertainment Television.</p><p>That’s when her name started getting recognition. For a few years, she was making headlines because of her relationship with the famous athlete Travis Kelce.</p><p>But now, the buzz around Maya Benberry is all about her comments regarding the relationship between Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. Yes, you heard it right – Travis and Taylor are an item these days, and they seem pretty happy together.</p><p>However, Maya has some strong opinions on the matter. According to her, Taylor Swift should steer clear of Travis because, in her view, he’s a bit of a cheater.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Maya Benberry claims that Travis Kelce cheated on her" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Maya-Benberry-claims-that-Travis-Kelce-cheated-on-her.webp alt="Maya Benberry claims that Travis Kelce cheated on her" width=400 height=691 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Benberry Claims Kelce Cheated on Her&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Alright, let me break it down for you. Maya Benberry and Travis Kelce crossed paths back in 2016 on this dating show called “Catching Kelce.”</p><p>Maya ended up winning the show, beating out 49 other contestants who were all trying to win the heart of NFL star Travis Kelce. After the show, they started dating, but their romance hit the skids after just a few months.</p><p>Now, the juicy part is that we don’t know all the nitty-gritty details about why Maya and Kelce called it quits. But here’s the twist – Maya spilled the tea on her Instagram recently.</p><p>She basically spilled the beans, saying that Kelce had been unfaithful to her and was seeing this sports journalist named Kayla Nicole on the side.</p><p>Here’s the kicker: in 2020, Kelce and Kayla Nicole broke up, and there were whispers going around that Kelce might’ve been a little too friendly with someone else during their relationship.</p><p>So, Maya, who’s kind of a big deal on social media, is advising Taylor Swift (yes, that Taylor Swift) to stay cautious with the Chiefs player.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Maya Benberry Boyfriend" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Maya-Benberry-Boyfriend.webp alt="Maya Benberry Boyfriend" width=400 height=504 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Maya Liked a Comment Claiming Taylor Swift is a 5</strong></h2><p>Besides Benberry sharing details about Kelce’s unfaithfulness, another interesting topic came up when Maya liked a comment that said, “Taylor Swift is a 5.”</p><p>When asked about it, Maya was very clear that she’s a big fan of Taylor Swift and doesn’t think of her that way at all. In her comment, Maya actually referred to Swift as a “boss.”</p><p>Maya also mentioned that she initially liked the comment because it included a compliment for her. However, as soon as she noticed the part where it called Taylor a “5,” she quickly unliked the comment</p><p><img decoding=async title="Maya Benberry Biography" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Maya-Benberry-Biography.webp alt="Maya Benberry Biography" width=400 height=502 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Maya Benberry Family Background</strong></h2><p>Maya Benberry was born on December 31, 1991, in Germany, but she spent most of her childhood growing up in Kentucky, America.
