Some of her biggest roles include Kramer vs. Kramer, The Devil Wears Prada, Big Little Lies, Mamma Mia, Angels in America&nbsp;and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/68cb085483f1-meryl-streep-only-murders.jpg><h2>Ashley Park as Kimber</h2><p id=eCiOy_VktC5 data-wc=54>Emily in Paris&nbsp;star Ashley Park joined the cast of Only Murders in the Building&nbsp;and we can't wait to see her in action!

The former Brassos actor moved into the Arconia and had the shock of his life when he found himself solving a murder along with two of his neighbors, and documenting it for a true crime audio series as the same time. But, now? He thrives in the excitement! In season three, Charles is returning to acting and has a role in Oliver's new stage production, but looks like he has beef with Ben Glenroy.
