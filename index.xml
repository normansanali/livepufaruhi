Many toolmakers regard 5/16 and 8mm to be interchangeable. 5/16 is about 2 thousandths of an inch smaller, 0.06096mm, but it shouldn‚Äôt matter on a hardened Allen bolt, and I‚Äôve never stripped the internal socket of a hardened steel Allen bolt.
Are 8mm and 5/16 the same thing? due to the fact that there are just 0.04/16 ‚ÄúBy computation, there is a discrepancy of 0.0625mm. As a result, the 8mm will be too big for the 5/16‚Ä≥ fastener, while the 5/16‚Äù will be too tiny for the 8mm.</description></item><item><title>Who is Fred Norris Dating Now</title><link>/who-is-fred-norris-dating.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/who-is-fred-norris-dating.html</guid><description>Fred Norris
