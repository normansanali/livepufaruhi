After <a href=#>conquering love triangles</a> and blending their lives, Jimmy ultimately called off their wedding plans after Chelsea revealed details about his past romantic history on camera. He told <i>Us </i>that, as a result, he could no longer trust the flight attendant.</p><p class=p1>After filming wrapped, they tried to give their romance another go — albeit briefly.</p><p class=p1>“He called me one day and nothing really changed in that little time period, and I thought maybe it would’ve because the cameras weren’t involved, maybe we really could make this work,” Chelsea told <i>Us</i>. “Our connection was so strong and I gave it a chance and he called me four days later and said, ‘This experiment made me realize I don’t want a relationship.’”</p><p class=p1>She added, “And I’m like, ‘Sir, you do realize we were going to get married?’ He was honest and his feelings were valid.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Love-Is-Blind-Chelsea-Blackwell-and-Jimmy-Presnell-Briefly-Dated-Again.jpg><p class=p1>Jimmy, however, stressed to <i>Us </i>pre-reunion that he “wanted to have a relationship” with Chelsea after <i>Love Is Blind </i>concluded. (Season 6 was filmed in March 2023.)</p><p class=p1>“We tried for a bit, but just nothing really came of it,” he explained, noting they spent time together “every single day” after production wrapped. “[We] sort of got right back into it, zero to 100 once again and we had fun during that time.”</p><p class=p1>Ultimately, Jimmy realized that some major “skeletons in [his] closet” made it difficult to move forward with Chelsea.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Love-Is-Blind-Chelsea-Blackwell-and-Jimmy-Presnell-Briefly-Dated-Again-3.jpg><p class=p1>“She broke a level of my trust. She wanted me to sort of validate how she felt about it, and I will validate how you feel about it a hundred percent of the time, but let’s validate … not on camera,” he told <i>Us</i>. “And so we were sort just having that same argument over and over again, and we both just kind came to an agreement that it wasn’t going to work.”</p><p class=p1>Jimmy had initially dumped Chelsea after he grew concerned that she brought up his secret about previously hooking up with one of his good friends while they were on camera.</p><p class=p1>“I was really, really blindsided,” Chelsea <a href=#>previously told <i>Us </i>of the split</a>. “We had our ups and our downs — and our downs were down — but our ups were so good to this point. A week before that we were over the moon [and] we were so good. We were just right before we walked into that date, we were talking about our wedding songs at the reception.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Love-Is-Blind-Chelsea-Blackwell-and-Jimmy-Presnell-Briefly-Dated-Again-2.jpg><p class=p1>Chelsea and Jimmy filmed the season 6 reunion early in March. They were <a href=#>spotted hanging out in Florida</a> together in social media snaps shared on March 7, leading fans to speculate that they could be on their third attempt at a relationship after reconnecting post-reunion.
