The Grammy-winning country music star, 57, was performing her hit “Don’t Be Stupid” at the Credit Union 1 Amphitheater in Chicago on July 1 when she took a tumble and landed on her rear, as seen in the video below. Shania didn’t miss a beat, though, as she kept belting out the tune, got back up and impressed the already-ecstatic crowd!</p><a title=@momma_morgs href=# rel=nofollow>@momma_morgs</a><p id=content-paragraph-3>How did she pull this off so good?!?! @Shania Twain <a title=shaniatwain href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#shaniatwain</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-4><a title="♬ original sound - Morgan Knipmeyer" href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>♬ original sound – Morgan Knipmeyer</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The stunning star, currently on her Queen of Me Tour, was rocking a shimmering silver ensemble featuring a sky-high slit during the incident. As she walked across the stage in front of one her bandmates, Shania’s knees buckled and she feel on her keester. It appeared like a fall of that nature would be plenty of painful, but Shania shook it off with aplomb. She quickly threw up her arm and righted herself to the ear-shattering applause of the audience.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The feat of showmanship comes after Shania recently <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>answered the burning question</a> of whether or not she ever met&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brad Pitt</strong>&nbsp;</a>after she famously sang about him in 1998’s “That Don’t Impress Me Much.” She revealed the answer when she stopped by the YouTube show <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Chicken Shop Date</a>&nbsp;and chatted with host&nbsp;<strong>Amelia Dimoldenberg</strong>.&nbsp;While the lyrics certainly are a compliment to the star’s good looks, it appeared Brad never had a chance to thank Shania for the shout out in real life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shania-Twain-chicago-concert-spl-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I wrote about Brad Pitt. I never met Brad Pitt,” Shania told Amelia. “I think he’s avoiding me, man, honestly,” she joked. As a refresher, Shania crooned in the song, “Oh-oh, you think you’re special / Oh-oh, you think you’re something else / Okay, so you’re Brad Pitt / That don’t impress me much.” The song was off Shania’s third studio album,&nbsp;Come On Over, and went on to become one of her biggest hits worldwide.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Although her and Brad never had a chance to talk about the song, perhaps&nbsp;<strong>Channing Tatum</strong>&nbsp;will give her a shout out, as Shania said she would choose the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Magic Mike&nbsp;star</a>&nbsp;to name check if she ever decided to reboot the song. “It’s Channing Tatum. I’m trying to think how I would sing that… Okay, so you’re Channing Tatum’ – yeah, that works,” she said to UK&nbsp;Radio Times&nbsp;magazine, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>.&nbsp; As for why she chose Channing, Shania said she it was because she had just witnessed the trailer for his new Magic Mike&nbsp;film and well…that’s reason enough.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49rZqygkaO2onnTsJiipl2brq240maaqKaTmr%2B1ecKhoJyZl6R6t7XDnqZo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
