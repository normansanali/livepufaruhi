Sure, they may have completely different lifestyles than Us — but when it comes to the way they dress in their downtime, they’re just as fond of <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">the same styles</a> as we are!</p><p>This is especially true for someone who has a down-to-earth vibe like <strong>Kristin Cavallari</strong>. She stays true to her SoCal roots through her fashion, and we recently realized a simple romper that she wore looks incredibly similar to this <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$27 version from <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">Vetinee</span></a>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kristin-Cavallari-Instagram-Romper.jpg><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Vetinee Women’s Summer Pocket Belted Button Short Sleeve Jumpsuit</a> for prices starting at just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$20</a>, available at Amazon!

As mentioned, its style is seriously similar to the one that the Uncommon James designer donned while filming her Instagram Stories. Shoppers claim that it’s made from a “beautiful” linen-like fabric that looks even better in person. It has a classic cut with some utility-style details — think a traditional collar, rolled-up short sleeves, buttons running down the front and plenty of pockets!</p><p>When we say plenty, we mean plenty. There are two button-flap pockets on the chest and two slip pockets on the hips, which are bound to come in handy! Who doesn’t love being able to leave their <a href=# data-link=1>purse</a> at home while running a quick errand? Consider it a bonus!</p><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Vetinee Women’s Summer Pocket Belted Button Short Sleeve Jumpsuit</a> for prices starting at just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$20</a>, available at Amazon!

Unfortunately, they don’t have an army green like Cavallari’s, but that’s not a huge issue for Us! We’re focused on the aesthetic instead of the specific color, and this romper from <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">Vetinee has exactly what we’re looking for!
