Boon’s follow-up comments haven’t been much easier to parse, but the gaming legend seems mystified that the internet is arguing about whether his next game is either MK12 or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Injustice 3</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=274 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false>On Wednesday, Boon released a video of a clock ticking from “9” toward midnight, then skipping the number “12” and arriving instead at “1.” His accompanying message was simple: “Does anyone know what time it is? #MortalKombat”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=574 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Does anyone know what time it is? <a href=#>#MortalKombat</a><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pXY2wlidde</a></p>— Ed Boon (@noobde) <a href=#>May 10, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>Gaming fans proceeded to freak right out and offer theories that the next Mortal Kombat game would indeed reset the clock on the entire series. Those conjectures were buoyed by a tweet from gaming news leaker billbil_kun, who stated that the next game in the series would be called Mortal Kombat 1 and also offered pricing information:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=635 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>EXCLUSIVE<br>🚨UPCOMING RELEASE🚨</p><p>Next Mortal Kombat game from NetherRealm Studios / WB Games will be called:</p><p>🔥 Mortal Kombat 1 🔥</p><p>🎮PC, PS5, Xbox Series S|X, Nintendo Switch<br>💲Standard: 69.99$ (PS5, XB) / 59.99$ (SW)<br>💲Premium: 109.99$<br>💲Kollector's: 249.99$ (PS5, XB) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/c5BCDg1Lec</a></p>— billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href=#>May 11, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=142 data-injectable=false>On Thursday, Boone returned to Twitter seemingly confounded that fans are discussing Injustice 3 as his next project instead of Mortal Kombat:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Uh…. did I miss something? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rFwF0ImVpd</a></p>— Ed Boon (@noobde) <a href=#>May 11, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=139 data-current-count=139 data-injectable=false>He then doubled down with another tweet highlighting the internet’s confusion and then, of all things, endorsing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the new Flash movie</a>:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Interesting trending items.</p><p>PS …. <a href=#>#TheFlashMovie</a> was great! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/MSv3XeiVT4</a></p>— Ed Boon (@noobde) <a href=#>May 11, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>First off, Boon is clearly stirring the pot here. If he wanted to truly dissuade people from discussing Injustice 3 then he would have plainly stated that the superhero beat-’em-up is not his next project. But perhaps Boon thinks he basically already said that with the teaser video about Mortal Kombat. Does anything in that video suggest that Injustice 3 is around the bend? Heck, the number “3” isn’t even shown on the clock.</p><p data-characters=573 data-current-count=573 data-injectable=true>Avid gamers have argued that Boon said previously on Twitter his next project was either MK12 or Injustice 3. The teaser seems to suggest he’s now picked one, but to make things more confusing, there might be a third option here. User MrTonyMaurizio jumped into the fray to remind everyone that Boon also has said he’d like to remaster the original Mortal Kombat trilogy. So perhaps the clock jumping from “11” to “1” actually means Boon is working on a remaster of the original classic before he proceeds to MK12 (sigh, or Injustice 3).</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>We may get answers at the upcoming Summer Game Fest in early June, which is basically the new E3. Warner Bros. Games — the parent company of Boon’s NetherRealm Studios — is listed as a presenter at the event and is expected to reveal a few upcoming projects. Until then, we’ll just have Boon’s vagueries to get us through the night.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8isZJplnaS%2Fta3LZqKopZKWwW6%2BxJumqKxdp7KiuMuyZKimXam1pnnWmrBmnZRir7C7zWaamq2jmsBur86nna6rmaS7bsPIrZ9mpJGpsrTAjJqlp6elo7CmucSnq2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
