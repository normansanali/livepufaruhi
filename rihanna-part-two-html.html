And now, as you might expect, they’re doing their best to stretch the story out for as long as possible. Yesterday, we <a href=#>got the first taste of Sawyer’s interview on Good Morning America</a>, the main takeaway of which was Rihanna’s plea for other victims of domestic abuse to “Eff love.” And this morning, ABC released <a href=#>another teaser</a> for tonight’s big Rihanna 20/20 special, one in which she begins to describe some of the events of that tragic evening. She admits that she became upset with Brown when he received a booty text from a third party and, when she refused to drop the subject, he turned violent. “He had no soul in his eyes,” she tells Diane Sawyer. “Just blank … He was clearly blacked out. There was no person when I looked at him.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-9257279b2ba54815abc9e60fd977c1cf-4-0-0@published data-word-count=10><a href=#>Rihanna Exclusive: ‘He Had No Soul in His Eyes’</a> [ABC]</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Rihanna, Part Two: Chris Brown ‘Had No Soul in His Eyes’</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlncmdhZnyztceapaeZj6Wus8C%2Bra6oZpipuq0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteZest - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
